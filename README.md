# Topic Modelling on Reddit Data

FTX is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, valued at $32B at the start of 
2022. It’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), is one of the most influential persons in the crypto 
industry. The company has various major financial companies as its investors and was largely 
successful but recent turn of events led to the firm filing for bankruptcy on November 11 and SBF 
facing investigations by the Justice Department and Federal Regulators. Consequently, other 
crypto companies are being destabilized and widespread distrust is sweeping the industry. This has 
again raised huge concerns about the industry which is largely unregulated. All of this happened 
in a span of two weeks, starting from November 2 when CoinDesk published a report pointing out 
inconsistencies in about SBF’s company balance sheets. With this study, I aim to 
understand how this event alone affected the sentiments around crypto industry and identify the 
major topics of discussion in the industry to understand the repercussions.
