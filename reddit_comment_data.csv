0,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,here is the twitter threaddirect link to the declaration ill just copy paste whats in it since theres very little to  sbf to be investigated in the course of the bankruptcy sam bankmanfrieds hedge fund lent billions to sam bankmanfried paper bird is his entity so thats at least part of the answer of where the money went ftx says the fair value of all the crypto non stablecoins that ftx international holds is a mere  personal note they do have  bill in stable this was a mistake my bad seems like the chart is in thousands of dollars so they have  the ftx group did not maintain centralized control of its cash cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories this is mad stuff  i do not believe it appropriate for stakeholders or the court to rely on the audited financial statements as a reliable indication  the debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the ftx group as of the petition date in the bahamas i understand that corporate funds of the ftx group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisorsedit  sbf   nishad singh  ryan salame  take  it could be ftx just used alameda as a cover story quite possible these guys were not doing any trading and just stealing customer funds having alameda was a good cover story for them to use the moneyalso sbf is a sociopath
1,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ftx is the biggest collapse of a corporation since  and this comes after  billion in lost funds  and  it was also revealed that   this  route was used to move assets in the billions of dollars without triggering alerts to staff and external auditorscrypto markets will never be the same as the fallout of ftx is rising worries among legislators
3,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,a tornado cash developer is still in jail without formal chargessbf committed  fraud and is playing video games in the bahamas  which he is losing btwcode is free sepeech but its said that money speaks so much sbf and his connections are making him a free man he lost billions but right now he is playing lol not a jokewe saw big support for the tc dev when he was arrested but atm theres not much talk about his situation due to market conditions and a billion dollar scammer is running around the bahamas as a community we need to raise our voice to this kind of injustice if not we wont end up better than  can sign the petition to free him here  credit to ubenjymememan
4,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,as most of you are already aware the  current situation with ftx is that they have made a super sketchy and  almost certainly illegal deal with justin sun to finance withdrawals  from ftx provided they use tron ecosystem coins for liquidity to do sothis means that justin sun is essentially offloading coins at a premium on  ftx whilst customers desperately buy into shitty liquidity and end up  paying way over real market rate for trx to get as much of their funds  off ftx as possible  what youre looking at is a  spike in price of tron on ftx as people desperately purchase tron to get their funds off of ftx and justin sun dumps on desperate victims of the ftx ponzi scheme this is what market manipulation looks likeapparently  the legal and compliance team for ftx quitwere fired yesterday so  there isnt anyone to advise them on the shit they are doing i am not a lawyer but this is not legal   whilst they are registered in the bahamas regulators in the us are almost certainly looking at this with wide eyes absolutely salivating at the shit show they are about to unleash on sbf and anyone that touched ftx
5,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,ftx official twitter released an update yesterday that some number of users who withdrew funds from ftx international on the  face having these funds taken back it is not certain what group or number of users are affected the funds are being returned to ftx to be accessible and adjudicated upon by bankruptcy courts as it is the entire ftx group including ftx us that filed for bankruptcy it is unclear why ftx has not stated that this also affects ftx us  most likely refers to bahamian funds on the platform where sbf and ftx both in separate similar tweets claim that bahamian regulators mandated ftx international to permit withdrawals by bahamian citizens a claim strongly later denied by the  and sbf also agreed to a credit facility with justin sun and his dao tron to permit withdrawals but only using sunowned token btt  trx sun jst and ht this credit facility was instituted  nov such that ftx may also be referring to funds transferred out through this facility on the  as well as any assets left on the platform at bankruptcy time would have already been declared through courtslastly very confusingly bahamas regulators have acknowledged seizing assets from ftx however it is also very unclear whether this seizure refers to the entire sum of missing funds of ftx assets or just some portion of it the tweet may also be referring to the stolen sum of money that represents the balance of what regulators did not seize these funds however are only reclaimable if the hackers made a rookie move and utilized centralized exchanges
7,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,john ray the new ftx ceo is the same person who restructured enron after its scandal his take on ftx under penalty of perjury  never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate  company did not have any cash management system expense reports were approved by emojis over chat corporate funds were used to buy real estate and personal items for employees loans were issued without keeping any recordsthere is so much going on with the bankruptcy that a  billion yeah with a b personal loan to sbf by alameda research is just a footnote i am guessing it was for charity sone of the worst findings was that there was no record of who made a particular decision sbf used applications that autodeleted messages and asked employees to do the same just as a reference for how crazy this is imagine running a  employee company on snapchatwhatever minimal auditing was done was also done by firms of questionable reputation ray has stated that he has substantial concerns audit for ftxdotcom was done by a firm that stated that they were the first cpa firm to open its metaverse headquarters in decentralandmost of the companies under the ftx umbrella did not have the right form of corporate governance some never even had board meetingsthe corporate controls were so bad that the bankruptcy firms do not even have the full list of employees imagine running a multibillion dollar company and not knowing which employees work for youfor someone running a crypto firm they kept no records of their digital assets we have no idea how much crypto customers have deposited in the platform sbf and wang had complete control over the assets and used backdoor software to conceal the misuse of customer fundsthe unaudited balance sheet provided as of sep  before the collapse for ftx us stated total assets worth  billion if this is accurate at least ftx us has more than enough to cover at least the fiat deposits not crypto of its customersonly  worth of crypto has been identified in cold wallets there was an unauthorized transfer of   in cryptos on the day the company filed for bankruptcy forensic analysts are now trying to find out what happened to the rest of the moneyall in all it does look like sbf knew what he was doing and did everything from not keeping records autodeleting messages and backdoor access to avoid getting caught this ones going into the history books
8,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,we all here exactly know how and why ftx collapsed we all know that sbf stole all of users funds to use them for himself and his other partners we also know that this actions lead to millions of lives being ruinedbut many people outside of crypto do not really know what kind of a fraud sbf ftx and alameda research were why because the media has been in a fulltime job trying to whitewash the actions of sbf and cohere are some of the few examples from highlevel media outlets people trust to show them the truth i already did an entire post about this  washington post article  that is doing nothing else but show sbfs actions in a good light they especially highlight his extensive lobbying efforts which according to them were for “pandemic prevention“ and obviously not him trying to have political connection to do whatever he wants now here we do not even have to go further and can see that the headline of this reuters article is already trying to really make a billiondollar scam to fill his own pockets look like a “favour“ forbes is also just talking good about the coceo of alameda research caroline ellioson fro whom we have already seen enough videos showing how highly mishandling she was forbes is portraying her as a “riskloving“ person and a “math wiz“ for your kind information forbes this “riskloving“ person risked and lost all the funds of millions of people around the worldit is clear that the media must have been paid by sbf to write such “shillarticles“ about him and his companies nowadays you can not even trust the biggest media outlets to tell people the simple truth of a story that made millions of peoples life worse thats just a shame…
9,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,never listen to this guy kevin hes delusional  sam had access to all trades liquidations insider info listings pumps dumps  got commissions got into project that gave him free tokens printed billions out of thin air with ftt and somehow he found a way to make losing trades and have shit risk and scam all his investors and customersand kevin is sucking him off wishing to work with him again  ive seen some stupid stuff this year but i literally was lmao at this  if you have anything invested in kevins company you should exit asap  he seemed so risk adverse in that stupid show but here he is showing not an ounce of risk management before during after this ftx thingjust remember this idiocy the next time he shills you something on his show or interviews  hopefully this is enough characters  this is comedy im pretty suredont forget how stupid raul pal is either telling people how great luna and sol was  i cant wait to see jonah hill play sbf in the stupid documentaryjust remember in  when guys pull the same playbook
10,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,this should go without saying but it needs to be said billionaires are not our friends somehow these people manage to amass cult followings who hang on their every word almost like gospel many of us have come to crypto for financial freedom and uses where conventional finance has failed us heck even if you are just here for the profits these people are still very bad source of advice and trust in them is misplaced trusti could start with sbf who seems to be intent on acquiring every single crypto company and absolutely crush the competition using what seems to beor used to be his unlimited bank account for unlimited buying power he has also recently come out with some very antidecentralization statements speaking of decentralization we move to cz who has built up an image of being very prodecentralization and yet skirts around and avoids the entire issue when its asked about regarding bsc on the  he claims that decentralization is a gradient scale and refuses to describe binances chain as centralized when only  validators are needed to alter or outright freeze the chain completely as we saw recently further any and all validators are chosen by binance themselves binance has also been involved in many cases of either  or outright just  while at the same time cz speaks warmly about the benefits and positivity of regulationselon musk outright manipulates markets to his whim and fancy and seems to find it a fun game that he partakes in  gleefully as investors may lose their life savings futures and family funds he talks a big game about free speech but has started permanently suspending accounts that impersonate others which are generally actually obvious account parodies especially those done to him he also plays a certain segment of crypto investors like fiddles who pump the market and get dumped on when he doesnt follow through on a tweet and heavily suggest ideas he has no intention of implementingi dont think i need to mention the likes of do kwon alex mashinsky and john karony as well as know their deviousness all too well on this particular note we should realise an important step in dyor never invest in any token or platform that has a single individual as the face of the entire company usually the founder or ceo as the face of the company all of these people are only here to feed their own ego and use the veneer of crypto freedom to attract those already holding resentment toward traditional finance to gain their blind trust they are here for the cash and the attention if nothing else find yourself a platform or product with a ceohead whose keeps hisher head down and puts in the work and doesnt have to tweet every hour for validationthis trickles further down into investment based on endorsements from celebrities like kim kardashian floyd mayweather and tom brady you can even include matt damon in this as while it was an aboveboard paid ad he was  using his name and influence to promote crypto and should clearly know the risks and backlash that it could bring but he seems to have blindly sold out for the moneyrecent market events have also shown that we give these people way too much power i saw a comment on the sub that said its actually not a bad thing if cefi collapses as defi would take over a very interesting statement
11,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40, from his  a huge thank you to everyone who has supported uswere excited to keep climbing together  and especially to those who stay level headed during crazy times  we deeply appreciate  a bunch of unfounded rumors have been circulating  you can see  ftx keeps audited financials etc  and though it slows us down sometimes on product were highly  weve already processed billions of dollars of depositswithdrawals today well keep going  taking up antispam checks to process moresorry if you got those  were hitting node rate capacity will keep going  also tons of usd  stablecoin conversions going  and in the end you should do what you want and trade where you want  were grateful to those who stay and when this blows over well welcome everyone else  as always  a huge thank you to our supporters  and to everyone else as well as long as they keep building and keep moving the industry forward  well keep building tooedit as i type this edit the post has a  upvote rate and every single person that has commented that they withdrew or similar sentiment has been heavily downvoted  it seems that the downvote situation stopped some early comments were deleted in fear of losing karma i guess also as pointed out in the comments ftxs stablecoin reserve just reached a yearlow  as of now  over the last two weeks 
12,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,hes done dotted
13,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,you are here for tech fineyou are here for money fineyou are here for revolution finebut why are you still here if you dont even take the chance to own your crypto why transfer your money to shady people like vlad why trust thempeople like cz sbf are becoming billionaires because we let them take the idea of crypto and turn it against us we literally take our saving and create those big guys we then want to fightfuck them lets use this crypto winter to actually achieve something lets make those cexes obsolete by simply using crypto as it was intended toby owning 
14,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,just as you thought the ftx saga couldnt get any worse think againftx and ftx us have just been hacked for around  and rising this was almost certainly an inside job as ftx and ftx us are two seperate corporate entities it is impossible that a hacker would have access to both of their servers keys and backups the ftx com site not adding link for fat fingers will download trojans and decrypt private keys from hot walletsthis is an absolute shitshow funds have apparently been zeroed out on ftx and there is almost nothing left to pay creditorsmain draining address shitcoin draining address  the ftx app is malware and will decrypt your keys uninstall it and do not touch ftxs  possibly unrelated but a private flight took off from the bahamas ftx   est kraken has found the insiders identity but hasnt released to public
15,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,as the ftxsaga continues also the false articles aiming to shill sbf are continuing in this  i say how various mediaoutlets are just trying to whitewash the actions of ftx and especially sbf as sbf was the person to give hundreds of million to them in “political contributions“ those articles were just talking about how good sbf was and basically were just a neutral biography of a person that scammed millions of people for millionsnow the first are actually starting to talk about the crash and fraud of ftx and sbf itself but even now they are trying to shift all the blame away from their actual poor management and the fact that they were using customer funds for their own gambles as we can see in this article of the wall street  are basically saying that the reason for the ftx collapse is that their “supporters“ which actually means the customers for them somehow have “betrayed“ them which does not make sense as sbf clearly was betraying everyone from day one also the article includes a very unnecessary comparison between trump and sbffor a small fun fact even elon musk straight out spoke that they are  is clear that the article now at least knows that there were mistakes made at ftx and with sbf causing this debacle but are not really pointing out how sbf was filling his own pockets and lobbied to the white house with the money of customers too
16,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,sam sent these messages to the company slack he states that his first priority is to make all customers whole and he plans to do that via a raise which may include ftx us as well fundraising options with binance have been exhausted but justin sun seems interested in helping out however from his tweets he seems only interested in making people who own his coinstron btt etc whole justin sun is also having issues of his own at the moment as his decentralized stablecoin has depegged these were leaked to a well known twitter account named cobie by an ftx employee and confirmed by another employee there have also been leaks that the employees had no clue what was going on as only the execs had access to the wallets and had the ability to cook the books many employees also have funds on ftx so they have also been fucked by sbf
17,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedentedfull quote holy shit that is damning
18,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,headquartering a major fintech  in the bahamas in a penthouse should have been a warning it was a ponzi tho…
19,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,all this information might be shocking but it explains the sudden collapse very well all these frauds were like a house of cards and it collapsed near instantlyits kinda scary the amount of shit ftx was able to pull with their customers money till now
20,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,don’t worry folks he said sorry and that he wants to make customers whole s
21,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is actually incredible ftx loans alameda money alameda then gives sbf money and this is all users funds lmao
22,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the new ceo of ftx who oversaw the bankruptcy of enron said this regarding sbf’s management never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial informationif the guy who oversaw enron’s bankruptcy is this baffled…
23,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,jesus christ this i did not expect this is way beyond the mismanagement i thought was happening
24,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the speed with which this guy has pulled together all of this information and got to grips with what went wrong is actually superimpressive
25,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,
26,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you telling me a group of greedy drug enthusiasts  years olds cant run a billion dollar company
27,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,all that while he was printing ftt from thin air
28,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the debtors did not have the type of disbursement controls that i believeare appropriate for a business enterprise for example employees of the ftx group submitted payment requests through an online ‘chat’ platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojis
29,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,he also said he was faking all of his ethics i mean we caught on it but saying it himself makes it  more sinister
30,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and this smarmy asshole was meeting with elected officials to draft legislation to dictate all of crypto in the us
31,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,waiting on the documentary
32,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the new ceo is significantly more brutal than mainstream media  lol  🤡🌎
33,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,from section d  paragraph idk what its calledat this time the debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the ftx group as of the petition date or the terms of their employmentdude come the fuck on they cant even fucking tell who actually worked at the company
34,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this speaks volumes to what kevin o’leary’s actual iq is
35,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i stand by my statement i tell everyone it was embezzled
36,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,real estate and items for employees wtf even worse than i thought how scam bankrunfraud handled the assets
37,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate control   remember this is the guy who handled the enron collapse
38,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,that clown deserves to spend rest of his life in jail along with his creature of girlfriend fucking psychos
39,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so essentially they treated investors funds as their own piggy bank a total ponzi scheme
40,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the guy overseed the enron fiasco and its out here saying ftx is far worse not in our wildest dreams can we imagine how badly sbf and alameda fcked things up
41,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,after this mess i decided to buy my hardware wallet and move my main investment therei’ll lose some interest but damn… these are criminals
42,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and yet this sociopath was able to captivate the entire mediasphere masquerading as some golden boy genius you cant trust shit out there
43,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,ftx says the fair value of all the crypto non stablecoins that ftx international holds is a mere  personal note they do have  bill in stabledisregarding the stablecoins even my moons are now worth more than ftx
44,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol sbf just straight up stole billions of dollars
45,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,who were the auditors they are likely toast after this
46,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,where’s all the loss porn  i feel like there should be more than celsius voyager etc but i’m not finding it  i find this very unsatisfying
47,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,wait so alameda was receiving loans from ftx off of customer funds and then sbf was receiving loans from alamedathis thing sounds more and more unreal by the day it actually deserves a netflix series at the point
48,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,no wonder sbf now says he regrets filing for bankruptcy  they hired the perfect guy to investigate his mess and set him up for prosecution it appears
49,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,interesting how everyone here is now all like “hah what did you expect these are  yo people” but none of these voices were here  months ago stop pretending you were any more wise than anyone else here no one that was not in on this knew what was going on and that includes all of us here
50,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i really hope there wont be a do kwon part  this egomaniac fool before he decides to start running
51,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,every one of these crooks deserves jail time
52,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,„never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial informationif that comes from the guy who helped cleaning up enron that quote hits even harder
53,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i mean how long did they think they could get away with it they must of known it was crumbling down
54,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this doesn’t make their general counsel ryne miller look that good as chief lawyer what exactly was he doing and they also had a chief compliance officer ex fenwick  west partner bad lawyers…baaaaaaad lawyers
55,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,did they purposely lose money to do illegal money laundering
56,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i mean mans did supply her a lifetimes worth of amphetamine she’s not totally innocent but she’s not blameless either

99,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,crypto needed this reckoning i’ve watched some real great insight and opinions flow this site and sub over the years but i’ve also seen some absolutely moronic bullshit get upvoted to the toptrusting individuals with unimaginable amounts of capital and no oversight pretty much never works out and the returns promised in the mess are always an absolute redflag i don’t know why so many people not in this sub in particular just in general thought this company was the exceptionit sucks that so many average retail investors are gonna lose real money here but it’s an expensive lesson lack of oversight and promises and riches are a scam… doesn’t matter if this coming from the mom next door selling you on here essential oils “business” or some mit grad taking money and hiding it in the bahamas
100,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the wheels of the ftx bus just went thump thump thump over the prone body of its former driver
101,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if i could ever envision what the face of a fart would look like that would be it
102,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,anyone seen the larry david comercial where he rejects ftx and it says dont be like larryi guess larry was right and people should of been more like him

107,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,havent you seen how some crypto geeks praised the ceo for even sleeping on the job red flag the length of the globe to me people say we cant judge by appearances but i would never trust this one man just by seeing him
108,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,let me guess theyll settle out of court for an undisclosed sum noone will ever get their money back no criminal charges will be filed as long as doj gets a fruit basket 😉😉 noone will admit wrongdoing and well all just keep trundling along in the hellscape weve made for ourselves
109,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,my goodness i literally opened and closed an account within two days because it just didnt feel right glad i listened to my gut
110,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,she loss money sam was doing as always giving her money to retry
111,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,he never saw things like this because usually who do things like this is a thief ready to be on a run and hide any track of moneysbf lives on total different reality he is not a thief because he thinks that in crypto he even can decide what is a thief or not he even said that he needs help for the bankruptcy process of the company first thing they do is remove him for that processand the conclusion of that is one of the most ridiculous delivering of documentation for a bankruptcy
112,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i get that novel ideas tend to have rocky starts as they find their place in the world but reading this after hearing about all the crazy hype of crypto being the future as a means to escape corrupt government  regulation of money is really off putting something tells me crypto isnt going to be a huge hype party in the future
113,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,yet they can’t explain how he even managed to get that loan…
114,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,nice he will prob trade the  billion into  billion by the end of the day problem solved at  leveraged he barely even needs the market to go up
115,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,it must’ve been her sparkling personality brilliant mind and loving heart that captivated him
116,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,“never in my career have as seen such a complete failure of corporate controls” they must have never met ken griffin
117,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,what kind of person needs a  personal loan no board no due diligence no accounting etc its worse than bernie madoff it was a koolaid party everyone was drinking it
118,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and at the end of it all  nobody will be held accountable the money will remain ”missing” and people will make the same mistake again with the next boy or girl wonder that gets lucky      elizabeth holmes gets sentenced later today  a woman that lied to investors actually gave instructions to provide people who trusted theranos inaccurate test results which led to who knows how many faulty medical diagnosis  she will probably get the  months of house arrest and not the  to  years in prison she deserves  sorry for the rant
119,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol and sbf in an interview says nishad is super affected and hurt by this yeah if i lent myself half a billion from the company i was supposed to be running and it collapsed id be affected too

135,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the debtors did not have the type of disbursement controls that i believe are appropriate for a business enterprise for example employees of the ftx group submitted payment requests through an online chat platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojishaha i love that
136,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,yes hello police crypto exchange ceos be wildin

139,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the this will be used as an excuse to regulate crypto further and bring in the government controlled digital currency almost like it was all planned from the beginning…
140,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the worst failure of your career so far
141,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i wouldn’t even call it a corporation more like a bunch of orgy loving friends… it was a  century scam you have been robbed
142,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the funniest part of all this is sbf is supposedly still firing out texts trying to raise  to save ftx a company he got booted from for frauding his entire customer base and pilfering billions and hes still messaging people like jack dorsey like hey could i have  minutes of your timebro this thing is more cooked than that pizza you put in the oven before passing out
143,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol im so glad i got out when btc was in the  range i already got burned once with mtgox pleased to hold no positions currently and watch this dumpster fire
144,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,there was no failure it was a brilliantly organized rug pull
145,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,oh wow i think this can get upgraded from netflix to hbo now
146,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, nice as a former user your check for  is on the way

148,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,we know that the question is where did it all go
149,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,thats crazy how can someone run a business like this put him in jail
150,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,scam bankrunfraud
151,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,ftx investors should take some of the blame they were suppose to be the adults in the room bringing decades of experience knowing pragmatic accounting practices for examplebut similar to the bernie madoff situation investors got greedy they didn’t look do due diligence but carried on like it’s a home runsbf takes a good chunk of the blame for sure but let’s not concentrate the blame to one or  people when the company its board it’s investors should have known  done better
152,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,just absolute pure greed nothing else to it the guy just kept wanting more and stole customers funds to fuel whatever obsession he had the dude and everyone else involved need to go to jail for a long time
153,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,holy shit is really is the new enroncant wait to watch the cold fusion video on this
154,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so he said enron was a shit show but  ftx   is a latrine porta potty  extravaganza
155,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,imagine losing hundreds of thousands or millions to this clown show and you have to start from zero that would drive me insane
156,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,sbf learned from gerald cotten just didnt learn how to disappearfake your death
157,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,they don’t have an accounting department are you actually kidding me that’s beyond belief an organisation that size should have hundreds of finance staff with countless qualified accountants this beggars belief
158,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i outtraded alameda this cycle confirmed holy shit
159,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,that  was  squid bought at the top
160,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,whats really wild is any of the existing exchanges could also be doing this so many warning threads here are dismissed as fud because well the company said theyre solvent and have  asset liability matching  of course they say that and anyway whats wrong with fud theres a lot of uncertainty and doubt right now with good reason you should be afraidthere is no oversight no sox no trustworthy independent third party audits this is what people build when you try to build a trustless financial system stuff that cannot be trustedtheres no hard evidence that theyre stealing or making negligent loans to each other fairbut there is evidence they are passing around coins to disclose their assets nb no liability disclosure which makes asset disclosure worthless anyway hmmm there is evidence that there are a lot more bad loans in the crypto system and there is precedent for straight up making shit up and providing faketoken assurances to cover your ass in times of distress
161,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,when will sbf be in jail
162,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,oh yes  vs just  lol lets be honest with the amount lost realistically there is zero difference between  and  lol
163,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is what you get when you let a “bro” run a financial institute
164,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,how has sbf not been arrested yet
165,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
166,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,new ceo is there even a company left to run
167,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you know what safeguards against this kind of corruption  strong regulations

172,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,yeah i’ll protect her if she wants me to she can hide out with me in a small midwest town
173,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if they are not going to jail then i will
174,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,we all know this was a scam now but im sorry what  ftx group did not maintain centralized control of its cash cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accountsnot to mention the debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the ftx group as of the petition date or the terms of their employment repeated attempts to locate certain presumed employees to confirm their status have been unsuccessful to date how do you not have a list of bank accounts and employees
175,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if you read the vox interview private twitter dm he never mentions that he only say i need to raise  billionsit seems hes mentally offline
176,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,netflix  part series in

180,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,of course he does  he will never own up to anything he’s done wrong bc he’s a narcissist
181,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the biggest problem with crypto right now is exchanges and how they run they take peoples crypto buy orders but never actually buy on the blockchain and move actual assets which hinders the true price value on cryptothen theres also the problem of us literally centralizing our crypto holdings on a non centralized crypto
182,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,im not following this too closely so im certainly missing something but where or who are these clientsftx i thought would have some semblance of a retail presence with custody of crypto bro   and  assets that are now lockedgone where are these bros with their pitchforks in all these threads am i just  not seeing themor was it all institutional money pensions and vcs will write down and move on blockfi already facing reality how many others are therejust weird thats a shit ton of liabilities to not have joe retail causing a hell of a ruckus online
183,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,cant believe the fact that people invested so much in the boyfriend and girlfriend company 
184,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this will go down in history alongside titanic pearl  and the  herschel walker trade to minnesota
185,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,ftx bailed out alameda with public moneyalameda gave loan to ftx ceo

188,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,what could go wrong with getting a person loan from anybody for a billion dollarsone would think that even the most brazen sociopath would stop for minute and think about the potential consequences that always go along with borrowing a billion dollars
189,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i feel like theres going to be a lot more jaw dropping moments in the months to come
190,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, related party loans receivable of  billion at alameda research consolidated consisted primarily of a loan by euclid way ltd to paper bird inc a debtor of  billion and three loans by alameda research ltd one to mr bankmanfried of  billion one to mr singh of  million and one to ryan salame of  millionlol this guy redirects customers cash through shell corporations to lend to his own company who then lends it straight to him   lock him the fuck up already  sick of seeing him act like he hasnt stolen everyones money and it was just an unfortunate snafu   this company was rotten to the coreya know its a shitshow when the new ceo literally has to preface all data he presents with a disclaimer about its likely inaccuracyhowever because this balance sheet was unaudited and produced while the debtors were controlled by mr bankmanfried i do not have confidence in it and the information therein may not be correct as of the date stated
191,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,people been shilling ftx all over too glad i didnt jump on that train and anchor protocol and luna that i was about to buy right before the crashi knew crypto was wild but god damn this is just nuts

194,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i feel like if sbf had dated a cougar with more life experience it could have worked out better for everyone involved
195,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,that’s a lot of assumptions to defend someone you know nothing about
196,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,enough to keep him out of prison presumably 😔
197,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,chamath palihapitiya a senior executive at facebook from  to  discusses ftx the interview is great and he talks about how ftx told his vc group f off when they did their due diligence and gave them strict accounting and board requirements on investments i found it very insightful  
198,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i mean the dude started off by buying btc in american markets for  then turning around and selling it in the japanesemarkets for  idk exactly what is wrong with that but i saw an interview with him when he said that and i immediately thought to myself “that’s not something i would be so willingly open to admit”
199,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,now do tether
200,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,how did real hedge funds that got involved with ftx not see that it was shady wouldnt the lack of proper accounting be obvious to a sophisticated investor doing proper dd
201,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,waiting to hear he blames his mommy for writing a paper that prejudiced his mindset to become a criminal

610,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,from what i understand at this point is that alameda had inappropriate levels of borrowing power from ftx when loans came due that alameda had to pay they paid them using credit from ftx  ftx didnt have appropriate oversight into how much alameda was borrowing and they basically robbed the bank at that point with proper oversight credit limitations and segmentation alameda should have been the only entity to go under as it was unable to pay for loans without the line of credit from ftx please correct if you see any issue with this explanation
611,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,sbf has quite possibly pulled off the biggest scam in history

753,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,ftx donated  million to gop  million to dem  the narrative that this is a problem for democrats only needs to be clarified they were donating to anyone that would push for regulation that benefited them on both sides of the aisle
754,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,was this the      distraction    billion type of thing
755,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,the thing that impresses me is just how much of a whitewash  platform for an aww shucks narrative this guy is getting its like the ultimate media hall pass
756,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i have always defended crypto as being pretty straight forward and not a ponzi scheme and this guy comes along and blows all of that out of the water with a straight forward ponzi scheme
757,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,why the hell do people believe him he is a thief a criminal just because mommy and poppy are from the upper intellectual class doesnt change that i hope one day we call fraud something like  he did a fried  instead of ponzi
758,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oopsies
759,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,arent you supposed to be qualified to be an accountant just blatantly admitting negligence because he knows hes untouchable
760,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,and he manages to get away with it sigh one of my friends lost money in this
761,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i mean since when have accounting skills been recommended for managing billions of dollars of other people’s money s
762,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,this should equal to  billion years in a high security penitentiary
763,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hate what that happens fr
764,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,as far as i understand it alameda was allowed to have a margin position on ftx without getting liquidated which can go well until the position goes so far in the red that liquidity runs out so indirectly they were borrowing money from the others that were tradingsbf must have decided to do it this way because he thought alameda has a lot of collateral they can post if necessary but then realized when cz announced that they would dump ftt tokens that the collateral is all shitcoins and can just collapse instantly also accepting your own exchange tokens as collateral is a terrible ideaalso the way that this transpired is super convenient for sbf who can now act like an idiot and explain this in a dumb way so people think they just dont understand even though its super simple
765,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i hate when that happens
766,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oh mama i lost my lolipop
767,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,the more i read about this guys statements the more ashamed i am of all the industry big wigs that continue to support and also invested in this guy and his ilk also ashamed of our legal system that do not care about the billions stolen or the victims it cannot be as simple as oh its cuz he is rich he is not

772,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,as the great father ted used to say the amazing thing about this case is that it’s not some amazingly complex fraud he just got customers to pay the money into ftx’s affiliated hedge fund…and then never transferred it from there into their ftx account 😂

779,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hopefully there is enough sufficient audit evidential matter to prove fraud on the face of it this has fraud written all over it where is the ex ceo of alameda she is flying way under the radar hopefully this will get constant media attention like enron sbf his parents carolyn her parents run with some powerful players i just dont see this snow ball getting smaller unless he completely covered the tracks and left no trace time will tell and this will be very interesting to follow for years to come i predict in  to  years he will be looking at  years in prison
780,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,“don’t worry about how much it is just send it all over eventually we will dig ourselves out of the hole and we’ll be rich and the customers will be none the wiser”

1183,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,very fitting that the top reply to his tweet is fuck off
1184,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,step  invent cryptocurrency to break free from evil banksstep  trust all your crypto to essentially a bank the only difference being that this bank is not subject to any regulation fdic insurance or consumer protectionsstep  all your crypto gets stolenstep  profit
1185,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,spoiled rich kid isn’t capable of empathy compassion or personal responsibility

1190,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this is going down in the history books for sure
1191,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,
1192,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he meant to type “twat” cuz that’s what he is
1193,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what about evergrande
1194,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the responses are actually hilarious
1195,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,a commentator on fox news said this morning‘and they said bitcoin is unhackable’literally has no idea what she’s talking about lmao
1196,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,were lucky its not lol
1197,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,that guy is just on drugs you dont do these stuff on a clear head

1200,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,that was it that was the play by play he wanted to take time to write up just kidding he took all of the money and now he’s blitz out of his mind like the ending to scarface
1201,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,hes communicating with someone using some type of codethats literally the only thing that makes sense
1202,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ultimately this is the reckoning crypto needed open source and decentralization is what crypto is supposed to be all about and the only way forward
1203,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it seems like “crypto” was a digital social idea introduced to both speed up and highlight human greed corruption and moral failures on a massive scale working as intended
1204,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what a timeline to be living in…
1205,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,buy a rig farm your self or buy crypto and put it in your safe wallet and by the gods make sure you actually buy a crypto thats been out for years like bitcoin  im sure im not the only one who noticed all the ruggpulls and bs the last years from pornstars trying to make a quick buck and random celebs  the luna bs and now this stop throwing all your money at new projects thats supposed to be the next new shit it usualy isnt throw in some you can lose and treat it as lottery you dont throw in all your savings at the lottery do you why the fuk would you do that to some random shit a kid made in a basement sure some crypto projects do great and you can earn alot but if you go by  you got a higher chance of failing just like the lottery so stop fuking around with your life savings thinking you get super rich insta  buy some bitcoin or a old coin thats proven it can last and got a good profit sit down open wallet in  years and cash out a good profit be happy
1206,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this pushes the decentralization narrative
1207,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what he meant was i fked u and you cant do anything about it
1208,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,treat your centralized exchanges like a visit to your dentist go in do whats needed to be done be gonecustodians can absolutely f you over crypto is about selfcustody if thats not appealing to you then traditional finance is much saferi wonder how many more mt goxs or ftxs are needed before this is understood the irreversibility of crypto definitely can definitely be exploited by bad actors
1209,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,watching you guys pretend you understand this  market is a hoot
1210,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,theranos was pretty huge as well what makes ftx so bad is they had no reason to leverage or take client funds they were already printing money
1211,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,how do crypto investors keep forgetting rule  over and over and over and over again
1212,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,is this the guy engaging in orgies dang money can buy anything lol
1213,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,abbott and costello perhaps  even in the absence of regulation in response to this itll sting there will be a trial if not multiple over this and its going to drag everything through the mud this could end up being the cryptocurrency version of theranos
1214,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,bro about to reveal his seed phrase
1215,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,can anyone summarize the difference between what went wrong woth luna and do kwon and what went wrong with ftx and sbf
1216,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,they say it’s just rumors for now but the pieces seem to fit closer to a financing of casual investments turned south as some companies do money can cover any transactions but if the buyer doesn’t want to buy they’re going to drive the market themselves
1217,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,shouldn’t this influencer be held accountable what does everyone think to be fair we all fell for this ponzi and thought it was legit
1218,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,hard to take the apology seriously when he built a secret back door…the mere fact it’s secret means he knew what he was doing was wrong as opposed to just making poor investments
1219,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the way i see it its  of users money thats not small change
1220,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,after hearing sbfs voice for the first time i can now see why he failed so epically
1221,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,my god when i say i gasped when i heard his voice the first time
1222,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sadly these types of criminals almost never see prison unless they steal from the wrong person
1223,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he said hed spell out what happened so far hes doing so
1224,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this scammer is totally off shape looking like a castrated pig
1225,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,who do exchanges hold assets on other exchangesthis is like me asking my friends to store my cash in their wallet  even though i have a perfectly good wallet in my pocket
1226,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,humans have become the dumbest species on the planet
1227,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,watching this leftist fraud  who is the progeny of other leftist frauds  crash and burn is so utterly delicious
1228,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,previous “scammers” still have followers and some people still believe them won’t surprise me if sbf still holds a fan base no matter how much he fks up
1229,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ftx basically got margin called and liquidated because their crypto mainly luna and ftt died
1230,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,here for the tech
1231,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, h
1232,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,but he also replies with h i kid you not guy must have had a stroke lol

1234,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what did you expect from him
1235,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,incorrect he followed that up with ‘h’
1236,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it was all a scam
1237,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,imagine hes trying to fake his death with a tweet
1238,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,whatwhat do you mean your upset that i stole your life savings 😡
1239,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,my guess is he took drugs to cope with this stuff wherever he is holed up or he is actually a bot that went rouge
1240,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,hes a clown im not surprised
1241,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,disregard exchanges acquire moons
1242,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,binance is the last place i would trade or store money you’ve been warnedi would buy usdt bonds from bernie madoff before i opened a binance account
1243,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he is trying to impersonate kwon
1244,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what what in the butt
1245,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, should be a small drop in the bucket for them doesnt seem impactful at all
1246,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,lol fuckin fraud giving away to political parties and donating to “charities” like ukraine
1247,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,loli love when they put tech bros in from of laptops so they can speed fake code
1248,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he was just handing out tom brady’s money  what a guy
1249,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,thankfully our gop leaders will get right on this and actually do something for onceany second now
1250,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,if you want to store your crypto off exchanges but cant get a hardware wallet and are afraid of hot wallets you could always use a mobile wallet then after writing down the seed phrase and storing your crypto just delete the app from your phone use the public address to keep storing more crypto on it and check it using the public address with website like etherescan then if you want to move crypto off it just put in the seed phrase and delete the app when you are done
1251,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,throughout history effeminate inept feeble and weak males like sbf would not outlive their teenage years…and that naturally weeded humanity from its waste… but no longer…
1252,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he definitely donated  but it wasnt to charity nor his money
1253,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the most troubling to come out of this entire debacle is that fact that the sec was an accomplice to all of this  who else can anyone trust in this corrupted financial system
1254,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,yah but the landscape of today is much different companies throwing around billions and billions of dollars and tanking and gambling and greedy  i feel like capitalism has hit a truly “late stage” sort of vibe over the last  years
1255,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i thought he was detained
1256,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,no proof yet and btw we’re still waiting to see all that proof from the election  big lie y’all are way behind
1257,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so when some said a few months ago that what was happening in ukraine was money laundering a conspiracy theorist was called  the theory appears to be true as are all the other conspiracy theories which have been shown to be an absolute truth
1258,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,“who”
1259,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,maybe in response to the death rumor
1260,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this ftx shit just keeps getting crazier and crazier the more i learn have they even caught the fucker yet either
1261,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,truly a very mature ceos
1262,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,perhaps hes trying to tell us the cause is a what and not a who what do i know
1263,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what’s next
1264,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, da fuq
1265,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i’m surprised he is still going on twitter instead of laying lowbut they never lie low
1266,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,im so pissed
1267,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,wallet get and use a wallet
1268,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so thats what unregulated crypto meanshmm
1269,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,its going to be part of his defense your honor our client clearly doesnt understand technology and found himself atop a company that he had no right to be running through a series of unfortunate events he tried to quit quietly as evidenced by his routine trips out of the office refusing to work with those who did understand the technology and taking it as serious as he did in these pictures while they proceed to show the court pictures of sbf in his normal attire and uncombed hairhes going to claim immense ineptitude because hes been dressing the part for years
1270,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,is it because he got handcuffed before he could finish the tweet
1271,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,annnd its gone
1272,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ftx is the biggest collapse of a corporation since  would imply ftx was valued as a companywhich it absolutely wasnt
1273,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,now binance has to go for the final nail in the cryptocoffin 🙃
1274,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this whole ftx just about sums america right up tons of money with idiots at the helm
1275,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he hasn’t been the ceo since last friday…so technically no the ceo of ftx didn’t make that tweet but the former ceo did
1276,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,don’t use ftx they said since  but you still did didn’t you
1277,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, evergrande anyone
1278,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this is exactly what the government wants to happen so they can regulate crypto into the ground it’s not a crypto problem it’s a dont keep your shit on exchanges you stupid stupid poops
1279,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,gee where are all the people who say mt gox was in the early days or only small unknown exchanges exit scam at now they seemed confident that big exchanges cant possibly lose their money learn from history or be doomed to repeat it
1280,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,dex  cexpeople will learn  eventually
1281,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,use cold storage exchanges are just unregulated banks with a shorter shelf life
1282,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it was only  years old run by this knucklehead weirdo the fried bankman right from the start was the whole ftx thing not a setup to  demand the government regulate crypto  funnel tens of millions of dollars back to democrat campaigns
1283,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,   acan anyone make a rhyme on this does he really mean ha like hahaha
1284,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,let me guess it was an accident it was sent there in the first place
1285,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i will die of old age waiting for a single one of you to post any evidence that ukraine gave money to ftx theres no source for this fabricated twitter rumor and no voluntary crypto contributions do not count as us aid

1293,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,getting rich with crypto is like that arcade game where the light spins around in a circle and you gotta hit it at the exact right moment to win except its really fucking hard and probably rigged besides
1294,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,no matter how many people get scammed in crypto there is another wave of suckers right behind believing they can get rich quick it’s a never ending flow of easy marks

1303,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,because he is  years old who had massive success it’s not like he runs a family business that was inherited for generations
1304,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this is all part of the plan for the great reset and the implementation of cbdc they needed this kind of failure in crypto to force their hamd
1305,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sam unbanking friends
1306,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,why would someone who already had billions even need to steal money theres gotta be more to this story
1307,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what kind ftx is different than mtgox stupid people always do their mistakes twice and then infinitelycryptocurrency is not an entity designed to be exchanged either via cexes or dexesall the exchanges are secondary entitiescryptocurrency has been designed to be accepted by all the merchants directlyonly after that happens exchanges have a right to come to the scene

1336,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,imagine doing fractional reserve banking without an authority to stop bank runs the whole reason frb works is because there is typically a government with guns telling you you cant withdraw

1343,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sorry guys i know lots of you lost money but i just cant understand the stupidity at throwing money at these obvious ponzi schemes what is crypto for if not opt in censorship resistant self custody not your keys nor your coins get your coins off exchanges ring any bells
1344,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he elaborated further
1345,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,why hasnt he been arrested

1352,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it wasnt mewould have been a funnier tweet

1356,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,wow well the writing is on the wall and the color is predetermined this whole mess and the timing of it is precise to the t this is the checkmate so many wondered how can the sec protect investors effectively they will implement law requiring investments into cryptocurrency only be allowed for accredited investors so bull run bear market who cares really only accredited investors look up the requirements to become an accredited investor and you will see how they have killed the retail investor
1357,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sounds like you three dudes are getting cryptod right now  someone creeped into your head and is now making you doubt the very thing that got you here dont let them in  i bet by april youll have wished you bought at

1363,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,imo all of this is just a long overdue wake up callif you got into crypto with  interest in a decentralized permissionless trustless parallel financial system you deserve this
1364,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,💎 🙌 forever right

1368,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i thought his account was also hacked
1369,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i thought a lack of regulation was heralded as a good thing in the crypto markets
1370,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,anything else thing it was just a scheduled tweet he never got around to deleting or finishing
1371,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,rip
1372,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,unregulated centralized actors in a decentralized space we made mistakes by thinking it was safe to use centralized platforms

1374,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,crypto hates it when sbf does this one weird thing…

1377,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i still can’t believe this is our reality lol
1378,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i disagree sure ftx is another incident that adds to the pile but imo it’s not necessarily the single event that suddenly increases the worries of legislators about security and protecting consumers those worries are way older than 
1379,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ripppp
1380,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so bad on those involved

2262,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,hol’ up tornado cash dev is in prison for what exactly
2263,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf extradition to the usa coming soon  meanwhile tornado cash developer has a name alexey pertsev i believe youre launching a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for his legal costs and for alexey pertsev and his wife to migrate to the bahamas
2264,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,justice is dead to corruption
2265,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i fully agree this is a miscarriage of justice the us government loves to put people like this in jail because they show us that there are ways around the centralized bullshit and the rules made by people who dont follow them
2266,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this post is misleading the tornado dev was arrested more because of his links with previously working for a russian govt linked firm on money laundering other tornado devs were not arrested
2267,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,from government pov things like open source software freedom of speech and people taking control of their money matters  of times more than a single fraudster government doesnt care much that people lost their money or lifesavings due to some scams they are more worried that their control over citizens and money cant be lost its the only way they can remain in power people like tc developer alexey pertsev and silk road founder rw ulbricht are most important and they will never allow them to set free its not about their crime but rather to set an example ans show the public that they wont allow common people to take control away from them
2268,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,you dont understand what the tornado cash developer made was pure evil while sbf just made an honest mistake
2269,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,if you give a man gun he can rob a bank if you give a man a bank he can rob the world
2270,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,when there are money  justice can not be found
2271,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,whats his handle on lol cant we all just go on there and grief him
2272,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the whole thing was a scam organized by gary gensler look at the connection between his girlfriend his professor and gensler just the timing alone theres no way this is a coincidence
2273,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,playing lolthat game still exists
2274,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,world is made for the rich and powerful
2275,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,you are omitting the fact that the tornado cash developer investigations has been ongoing not in public for quite some time and it is a simpler crime to prove it is like proving whether a drug dealer actually carries drug which is “simple”financial crime could take years to be properly judged that is even despite the fact that the crime has already been pretty clear people involved will look through all the books and evidences which is the reason it can be super lengthyhonestly i would suspect that sbf will be jailed just a matter of how long and when
2276,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,tornado cash dev was chosen as a scapegoat whereas sbf just played by the book it’s outrageous
2277,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,name one single person in bankingfinance that went to jail following   the entire us economy was a fraud engineered by the institutions we continue to use to this day  from aig to goldman to jp morgan  the citizens of the us got fleeced the likes never seen before in history no jail for anyone
2278,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the government can never be transparent in handling justice
2279,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf bribed some important names in the governmentthey are very careful about dragging him down as some politicians would go down with him
2280,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this is perfect example of the society we live in corrupted af i hope that justice will catch sbf but with his connections i doubt that
2281,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,they will use the sbf fraud the one that has been run by a centralized company to demonize decentralization
2282,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,those tornado developer should not be prosecuted because it is not them who use the system to do criminal acts while sbf is the brain of this ftx case
2283,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,what games is he playing i will commit to make the games unplayable to him
2284,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,one person is in the bahamas the other wasnt maybe both shouldve committed their crimes from dubai
2285,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,after the  financial crisis the only bank to be criminally charged was a tiny one in chinatown new york called abacus bank justice likes to attack people who cant afford expensive lawyers
2286,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,what is the gamertag  we could all troll him  some geek could ip track him etc  i have not lost money cause of him but i feel for everybody who did 
2287,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf reminds us how corrupt this world is
2288,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,are you for real this man really doesnt give a shit about the lives he has destroyed a sad excuse for a human being instead of looking for a solution or trying to make amends for his failure he decides to game what the actual fuck
2289,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,easy bud it’s been  days
2290,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,what sever does he play lol on just curious haha
2291,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sam prolly mains teemo top with tp and ignite summons
2292,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the fatter pocket speaks louder
2293,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the real moral of this ftx story that everyone is missing is that league of legends players are evil
2294,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,donate to the right campaigns and you get away with whatever the fuck you want
2295,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,hes yet to be brought back to the us by fbi  i dont believe hes getting out of this one
2296,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,changeorg is nothing but a water gun
2297,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,if hes in jail gun developers should be in jail toothats the logic being used here
2298,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i get that everyone is pissed they lost their money in ftxftt but we’ve really only done this to ourselves if you want consumer protections and clevels to be held accountable then petition your government to make strong regulationspeople went to ftx because the derivatives fees were around the lowest on the globe what did y’all think they were doing by beating the rest of the competition that’s been around since  not your keys not your crypto sure but also do your dd and research the company there’s a reason why coinbase and binance have a good track record it’s because they are stricter than current global regulationsi’m mad at sbf too but the blame is not solely on him
2299,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,what’s even more interesting and f’d up is that the influencers and brand ambassadors for ftx are now getting sued but yet sbf is grocery shopping in the bahamas what a perfect justice system we live in this is what happens when you have the people with power feds involved with the biggest scam in history
2300,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i love sofware
2301,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,hotass take tornado cash guy was the result of an investigation sam collapsed on his own and there hasnt even been enough time passed for an investigation
2302,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,so if i hypothetically made an open source program to blow nuclear reactors it would be all good because its open source and i wouldnt have done anything illegal
2303,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this guy is bernie madoff   if hes not getting life in prison there is  something fishy going on
2304,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17, sbf was laundering money for american politicians while the cash developer was developing for everyday pplthat’s the difference
2305,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,if you have enough money and grease the right pockets the word legal just has a different definition
2306,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,thats the perks of political donations to the government lmao
2307,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,these laws only apply to the poor sbf was working with sec and gensler
2308,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,political donations arent done out of the kindness of your billionaire heart theyre there for when you need to call for help
2309,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,should have donated to democrats 🤣
2310,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,that is assuming justice system is fair which is really not the case
2311,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,ah you made a classic mistake i see heres the correct titleafter  billion fraud guy with corrupt ties is free while guy without corrupt ties is in jail for developing open source software
2312,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,well the difference is sbf has a lot of money billions if not millions and his parents has political connectionsthe tc dev is probably just a normal guy like  of people in this sub
2313,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,please make it make sensethese types of cases prove no matter what you may believe about your governments and their masters they do not care about you we mere peasants losing millions is exactly what they want but we mere peasants getting money past them that’s a big no no and when they say they want to regulate to ‘protect the public’ that means they want to regulate it to their benefit where it’s them that make the most money from it hence why most crimes to do with money merit bigger prison sentences than pedophiles another example that they do not care is things like covid they will bankrupt you and leave you homeless when your paying insane money to treat your cancers and other genuine diseases but you can have all the covid vaccines you like for free as long as it’s pumping their moderna or pfizer stocks getting them rich rich absolute crooks and people vote for these pigs thinking the next guys different when their all from the same club and you ain’t invited
2314,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,some speech is freer than others
2315,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,okay but the tornado cash dev didnt donate multiple millions to the democratic party leaders rookie mistakethe attempts at whitewashing sams crimes by the media is downright insane feels like im in a simulation
2316,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,which one gave millions to the democratic party 🤔
2317,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this isnt complicated this guy fuels and donates to the biggest criminal enterprise in the united states he isnt going anywhere unless they lose their power
2318,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,that is some shit i love how tornado is open source as well we are all tornado cashdonating to dems is probably the best move sam has ever done bc he is not going to jail 
2319,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,strange its almost like sam had help from a bigger source 😉
2320,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,tornado guy should of donated money to the dems and hed be eating turkey at home instead of getting his potatoes mashed by bubba
2321,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,kanye was right evidently
2322,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf has bought a lot of political influence
2323,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,im not american but im just scratching my headyour government sanctions all over the world ordinary workers who worked for a company that was only involved in gas pipelines from russia to germany  and here we have a person who knowingly robbed thousands of people and then calmly flew to the bahamas and enjoys the stolen property
2324,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,note the key  sbf is a pawn of washington neocon  he was the biggest crypto figure arguing for global ofac  while tc was actively undermining ofac and neocons controlin america people can riot and kill each on the streets police brutality can kill in broad daylight  heck we can even say fuck you to funding early childcare but you cant mess with the militaryindustrial complexs money and influence govt can run into a debt crisis social security can run into insolvency and we can keep our road derelict with potholes but for dear god you have to squeeze every tax dollar to feed the insatiable militaryindustrial complexreally still cant figure out how sanctioning every iranian or sanctioning cuba helps america in any way
2325,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the man who created the gun is in jail while the man who fired the shot that killed is working free
2326,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,tell me how much you have in your wallet and ill tell you what your punishment is
2327,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,because sbf is the fed in a scooby doo villian mask
2328,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,he bribed the right pockets with stolen money
2329,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sad

2333,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,code is free speechthis should be on a tshirt
2334,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,they should be swapped sbf should be the one in jail
2335,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,corruption at its finest
2336,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,probably forgot the kickbacks

2338,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i bet they dont like his tech was a direct concurrent to traditional ways of fiscal anonymity sofisticated offshore schemes and bribes
2339,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,no wonder he plays lol i knew he was the kinda guy to be a tsm fan
2340,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,one helps citizens keep their cash and one collects it and feeds it to the government 🤔
2341,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,dirty dirty

2345,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,let that sink in
2346,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,alexey pertsev will be charged by the end of next week
2347,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,how is it even legal to keep someone in jail if theyre not guilty of something you dont know what theyre guilty of
2348,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this world was never fair
2349,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,yeah thats absolutely a madness
2350,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the tornado cash developer made the unfortunate mistake of not donating  of millions of dollars to one of the major us political parties
2351,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,lets now remember the ross ulbrichts case also world is fucked up
2352,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,if theres one beautiful thing about this that is that tornado cash contacts are still working and are actually used more than before arrest fuck deep state
2353,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,muricaaaaa
2354,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,gov is in on it that’s why…they got caught…you’ll see…
2355,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the government doesnt view stealing your money as a real crime so im not surprised
2356,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,well we know already money can buy anything its like a investment of his and giving him  a profit
2357,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,joshua homero garza is free after his gaw miners scam and is not only surviving but thrivingdude stashed away millions and has been laundering them through a taco business with his brother carlos and networking shell corp with his other buddy lrthey are living the life now cars toys scooping up properties three month long trips to hawaii in the wintersthe tacos are actually good but the injustice makes it hard to swallow
2358,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,what are the formal charges to be brought upon sbf can anyone enlighten
2359,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,didnt donate enough to political parties
2360,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the difference is that ftx lost users funds tornado cash could be used to evade government funds aka taxesthat the world we live in steal  from users nothing happens „steal“ from the government by avoiding taxes go to jail for  years
2361,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i wonder how bad hes getting shit on in lol jokes aside didnt you know you have to rub elbows with mr gensler if you want to stay a free man
2362,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,
2363,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,couldn’t agree with this more
2364,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,thats how life worksyou are rich you can do whatever you want no repercussions you are poor get fucked bitch
2365,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,the system is corrupted and totally 💩
2366,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,owe the bank  thats your problemowe the banks  billion thats the banks problem
2367,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i hate break it to you but life isnt fair sbf will get no more that a smack on the wrist
2368,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,isnt the fbi planning on extraditing him to the us its not like they can immediately do that the second ftx collapsed you need evidence
2369,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,alexey pertsev deserves to have his name and story plastered everywherehe has been wrongly imprisonned for nearly  days nowyou can sign the petition to free him here 
2370,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,no regulation they can do whatever the f they want but if someone of us did that like sbf we would be in jail long time ago
2371,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,makes no sense…
2372,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,what cum stain is in charge of this outcome freealex
2373,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,his day is coming
2374,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,why is it legal in the netherlands to hold someone without charging them
2375,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,because they werent willing to go under the desk in the oval office
2376,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,alex pertsev made the crucial mistake of not donating to  powers that be
2377,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,redditors understand criminal jurisdiction challenge impossible
2378,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,wtf i had no idea that dudes in jail what a world
2379,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,kinda but not  sbf just isn’t in jail  the tornado cash guy didn’t just write the code he was taking a cut from each transaction so he was profiting from money laundering
2380,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,so tornado cash man is in jail because he created an open source code that people used to money launder with sbf blatantly stole billions from users of his exchange it is a shame he has connections so high up the political ladder extradition needs to happen to this bastard as soon as possible
2381,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,thats because tc would give people financial freedom but ftx was just as centralized as the fedcant have these peasants walking around all willy nilly now
2382,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf is not playing video games he is continuing to steal money right now under the noses of everyone because he has not been arrested read bloomberg this morning if you dont believe me
2383,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,you have to do it anonymously or be prepared for the powers that be knocking on your door to bribe you extort and influence you or to threaten youand it escalates from there  looking at it from that angle makes you see the crypto market a little differently
2384,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,bounty hunters
2385,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,allegedly the tornado cash dev has ties to russian counter intelligence  its only a coincidence that this was discovered and acted upon on like the same day that tornado cash was sanctioned code is free speechits bs that they were arrested on seemingly made up charges but code is only free speech in countries that deem it so  there are countries where free speech isnt part of the constitution or a right that citizens have
2386,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this is usa
2387,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf knows they cant extradite him from bahamas without serious connections in both countries pulling strings which sam has already pulled 🤣 he picked bahamas for a reason  gonna be a long process trying to extradite him and probably wont happen tbh
2388,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,if developers create something that loved community is worthless he shouldve done it for the government always the government meme
2389,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,tbh i dont really follow this so was the dev actually running the site as well or others ran the site with his code surely this is more about running the site than writing open source code that could be used for illegal purposes
2390,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,ftx endorsed by the wef just saying
2391,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,its different
2392,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sounds like the developer should have donated millions to politicians
2393,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,one helped the dnc the other did not
2394,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,yeah it’s all about who you know wouldn’t be surprised if this sbf was just the front name for this whole thing and it is tied to a bigger thing
2395,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,one is accused by the government of laundering money the other donated  to the presidents campaign
2396,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,when will alex be released
2397,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,capitalism in all its beauty let the poor blow it
2398,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,crazy
2399,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,apparently donating to corrupt politicians helps keep you out of jail
2400,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf paid  to the democratic party during mid terms he paid his 🎟️
2401,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,ftx is also a cryptocurrency mixer
2402,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i totally agree with your thought process there certainly does seem to be some injustice between the two situations
2403,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,yeah i’ve seen this one my uncles generation had some nice kids in it that figured out a neat computer thing that let us fill our ipods with any music for free then metallica and dr dre teamed up and jettisoned the young trio of programmers into the sun and we all just stood by and watched but their deaths led to a paradigm shift in the music industry and so their noble hearts live on through the wonders of monthly spotify subscriptions and apple music purchases
2404,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this goes to show that crypto regulation is not based on fair and leveled information
2405,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,imagine being put in jail for writing code on a public blockchain for public use a code which by the way can never be deleted i think its a crime this guy is in jail and sbf is going around tweeting all this bullshit from his bahamian orgy honestly the priorities are fucked here i really hope sbf get to live a long live in a jail cell and the tornado cash developer is freed
2406,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,it is just absurd at this point
2407,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,political connections that is the answer to why this is
2408,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i’m gonna take a shit on my phone
2409,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,but bruh he wasnt a democrat donnar and having  a plate speaking events with janet yellen
2410,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i don’t believe in stealing but  i always say “if you’re going steal steal a lot”
2411,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,sbf dad is important in law stop speaking of him or youll go to jail yourself mate
2412,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,and no one on epstein’s client list has been prosecuted this is the corrupt world we live in
2413,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,ofcscambankrunfraud is doing what the system wants  scaring all of the idiot normies out of crypto while the cbdcs are being worked on and rolled out  and the rich love it when poor ppl get robbed  just look at robinthehoods vlad  he barely got his hand slapped  the only problem was that some poor actually made some money and some billionaire hedgies lost oh fuck we better have a senate hearing to discuss how to make sure this never happens againtornado cash was giving the ppl powerautonomy  tptb fucking despise that shitexpect him to rot in jail foreversatoshi staying anon was maybe the smartest thing they ever diddecentralize  if you are going to create something  just fucking give it to the world open source  then the genie is out of the bottle and it cant be stopped  but if you try to have a fucking website or a company or anything centralized that threatens the powermongersbankersetc  the boots of tyranny are coming to stomp you into a muddy puddle
2414,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17, at  signatures this petition is more likely to get picked up by local newsyeah sure lol
2415,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,you’re the guy who watched better call saul and thinks saul is the victim
2416,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i mean did alex pertsev give millions upon millions to the democrats i think we all know the answer
2417,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,you know the demographic here should be smarter than average people and at least average wealthy but we seem to always get fucked have no lobby and no plotical connections kinda worries me what that says about our community
2418,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,are you fucking kidding me how do you suppose sbf should be in jail at this point shit takes time and anyone who thinks everyone including sec and ftc dont want to make an example out of him is delusional
2419,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,i dont think sbf will be free for long dunno about the other guy
2420,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,we dont like in a free society anymore
2421,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,didn’t you hear he’s really sorry about it and had no idea they gambled away user funds if he hadn’t declared bankruptcy on accident everybody would totally have their money by now if he were in charge and this message totally didn’t come from his attorney parents
2422,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this finally someone brough this up i was fucking farming karma to write a post about this
2423,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,this corrupt democrat govt just cares about controlling people tornado cash prevents control sbf obviously was a big source of money for the democrat party sbf was basically a deep state operative of course he is getting away with this
2424,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,no one is posting news about the tc dev that was arrested its like they are trying to swept it under the rug
2425,yxkat4,2022-11-17 07:58:17,lesson learned become a democrat and be generous with your donations or else
2726,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,step  scam your users step  do it againstep  do it againstep  profit
2727,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,damn when tron said they would help i thought there was something shady going on this is price gouging to the extreme
2728,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,what an absolute disaster this whole thing is are the all freaking criminals
2729,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,oh look… crypto exchange owners becoming minigovernments towards each other this should end well
2730,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,we’re watching history in the making hereyou know those ridiculous safety signs like a stick figure driving a dump truck into a crowd of people and there’s a big “x” through it indicating don’t do this we have those because someone did something idiotic just because they could and it hurt a lot of people and cost a lot of money and resulted in years of litigationapparently sbf missed the “hey stupid don’t do this” sign because we’re watching the next enron right in front of our eyes
2731,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,well that’s the only way a shit coin like tron is ever going to pump
2732,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,good ol justin sun those two deserve each other as cell mates
2733,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,tron is up  today what am i missing
2734,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i doubt justin sun is banking much of that money remember people are buying trx with monopoly usd on ftx
2735,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so glad i never bought eth from ftx to move my moons
2736,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,that is so ridiculously dodgy how are they allowed to do this
2737,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its what desperation can do pretty sad really
2738,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,one way outwhen you want out you want out
2739,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this seems like some next level insider trading
2740,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,they should hold reddit liable for their partnership
2741,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,there’s blood in the streets and sun sees a risk on opportunity anyone blaming him is misplacing blame that should be given to sbfsun is providing liquidity with the the risk that usd on ftx might be worthless people buying trx at inflated prices are trying to salvage whatever value they can with the idea that it might be there only chance to and get it off the exchangeis it fucked up what happened to people on ftx absolutely but no one’s put a gun to their heads and told them to make these trades there’s a possibility that people who stick it out will be made whole but there’s also a possibility that they’ll be left with nothing the market has determined the premium of getting your money out and we’re seeing what that is now
2742,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,what goes around comes around this will come back to them
2743,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so you want crypto regulated
2744,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,whilst they are registered in the bahamas regulators in the us are almost certainly looking at this with wide eyes absolutely salivating at the shit show they are about to unleash on sbf and anyone that touched ftxeven though us customers are unable to use ftx they have their own ftx called ftxus which is separate to ftx international and isnt currently suffering from insolvency apparently so it will be interesting
2745,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,ive heard so much shit in this subreddit about tether collapsing but i have not heard about the utter shitness of ftx once yeees im sure there were a few threats but definitely not enough to call out an exchange that  i learned this here just before  was run by  people who were living in a penthouse that was shaped like a cruise ship and who were romantically involved with each otherjesus christ ftx was an incest circus i got no money there but no thx to this subreddit
2746,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,and yet we enabled them
2747,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,crypto in a nutshell
2748,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,how do these people still walk in public
2749,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,retail gets fucked over everytime
2750,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is what happens when a seasoned crypto criminal joins forces with the biggest scammer in the industry all this white knight bullshit aged like milk the only thing they discovered was a way to keep making money off desperate people
2751,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00, apparently the legal and compliance team for ftx quitwere fired yesterdaydo you have a source for this whats the basis of this knowledgeedit can be found here 
2752,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,better than zero
2753,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,the depravity in this space knows no bounds i thought the sec is already looking into it all maybe not a good time to be committing more shenanigans but do they even have jurisdiction over the non us ftx
2754,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,absolutely tragic sbf better be going to jail millions of ppls lives ruined bc of this fkn altruistic pos
2755,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so basically their getting fucked twice
2756,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,exploiting the weak and needy… this is just sad
2757,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,not sure how this is illegal because its not there is only a finite number of trx coins and trx related coins in user wallets on ftx he said hey sbf get me the numbers how many of these shit coins do your users have on paper sbf says our database is showing users have xyz he says okay not bad in order for my ecosystem not to suffer ill front you all those at my  do you think this is illegal if justin sun is the one dumping he still has worthless usdc and other coins hes getting in return of his trx hes dumping which is essentially worth nothing the people selling their trx right now for other coins are the ones taking the risk so the premium makes sense i could sell trx for  on ftx and have usdc on paper but ill never be able to withdraw it most likely
2758,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,must be tom brady
2759,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,sighbarely dodged celsius and got caught in this ftx shitshow
2760,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,can someone  the end result it sounds like sun is providing coins and in exchange is receiving money that cannot be withdrawn probably best understood as claims against ftx in a future insolvency proceedingthe whole thing sounds shady to my inexperienced eyes but is it a reasonable inference that the buyers seem to think the value of their expected insolvency claim is about  percent of face value
2761,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,fuck these guysthis is why some regulations are needed
2762,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,justin sun is basically exchanging coins for nothing
2763,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,sooooooo  tron will basically be worth  and nothing more than a meme after this
2764,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,wow what an absolute clusterfuck of a mess this is for crypto we are never going to financially recover from thisim so glad i never got involved in exchanges other than coinbase and that i dont have any funds in anything other than eth and btc never got involved with nfts never trusted any sketchy unregulated services never bought any weird shitcoins the longer youre in crypto the more of a maximalist you become
2765,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,wait so are we now calling for more legislation when shit hits the fan its almost like were relearning why legislation exists in financial markets in the first place
2766,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is the unregulated nature of massive cex’s is this what we all want
2767,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,ahh fuck it at least that person didnt lose it all this has all been a fucking shit show
2768,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,thats insane
2769,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,old man potter is paying  cents on the dollar across town
2770,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,big fish always find a way out  i wonder though every year how much money is lost with these kind of fraud like situations
2771,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this sam guy is certain to serve timw
2772,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,if sbf doesn’t go to jail it’ll be because he’s a government agent or he was epsteined by all the people he screwed
2773,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,apparently the legal and compliance team for ftx quitwere fired yesterday so there isnt anyone to advise them on the shit they are doing  nothing compliance personnel can do to stop it
2774,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,after the first  major failures this year no idea how you still had crypto on any exchange at this point
2775,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,their legal team quitwas fired today
2776,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,man that is insane people are desperate
2777,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,im waiting for the “chilling in ” tweets lol
2778,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,welcome to freedom
2779,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,common procedure when scamming people
2780,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i’m confused how is justin benefiting from this even if he is offloading coins at a premium on the exchange he can’t take his money out again since there is no liquidity right serious question btw not trying to defend tron or justin
2781,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this whole saga will be an american greed threeparter for sure
2782,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,the second js entered the chat is the second anyone giving ftx the benefit of doubt should’ve noped the fuck out
2783,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,lol are people still buying into that guy i thought it was determined a long time ago he was nothing but a scammer why do people fall for the same tricks
2784,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,wow its so bizarre to me still how quickly ftx went from like this very trusted institution of mit geniuses to the ultimate shitshowim realizing now that sbf was always talking about how few employees he had and that he didnt need extra people blah blah i bet that was bullshit too maybe ftx only had a dozen or two employees but he had such a huge web of companies
2785,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i just posted this on twitter but will say it here too i am disgustedthis space is not going to make it without serious regulation im sorry to say there are just too many human beings who are greedy scumbags and have no qualms harming others for their own gain its why we cant have nice things
2786,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i don’t think ppl realize how connected sbf is look up who his parents are
2787,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,no one ever goes to jail so it doesn’t matter  if no one is going to arrest sun and co then what’s the point
2788,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,is anyone shorting ftt
2789,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this would be amazing to watch both burn to the fucking ground
2790,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,well shit so don’t buy tron right now got it lol
2791,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,scam of the scammity scam
2792,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,when  scumbags join forces the customers suffer
2793,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,lambo moves
2794,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is so bad for the entire industry and ecosystem its not funny actually super disappointing these people like justin sun are supposed to be global leaders in the space and they are just shitting in their backyard  honestly though they are going to be multi multi  millionaires from this cuck shit so i guess they wont give a fuck
2795,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,hope justin sun  tron collapse nextcrypto will be a better place without them
2796,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i think its time to acknowledge the elephant in the roomcrypto as a whole has become a circus an absolute embarrassment
2797,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,new day  new scam move on a market 😒 hope defi infrastructure will speed up its techsecurity to say bye all the centralized shit
2798,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,should’ve kept my tron bag
2799,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this makes me lose faith in crypto but i still cant wait for the next bull run
2800,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,what if trons shenanigans also take tron down along with ftx
2801,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,lesson to be learnt never store your crypto assets on the exchangeusual drill however boring it must be said  not your keys not your crypto
2802,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,why take factor of  loss might as well take your chances thats basically losing everything anyway
2803,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,dont blame justin for this its all sbf doing he is just using trx because of fast transaction time and have enough liquidity for unloading on other exchanges
2804,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,and this is why we have regulations and compliance for years weve heard the nonsense about how crypto decentralisation solves all problems yet here we have another exchange going to the wall and yet more shady shit going onpersonally i remain interested in crypto but im finding it hard to shed a tear because of peoples naked greed
2805,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,at this point they should just allow users to withdraw with a hefty liquidity tax it would help balance the books and calm things down while letting users who really need the money be able to access it   as this shows there are people willing to pay  for the privilege
2806,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,is it possible to buy tron on binance transfer it to ftx and sell at marked up price
2807,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is a shitty look for crypto its savvy but fucking outrageous and sickening
2808,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is parody right so i’m reading you right just to check… you’re saying that a ponzi scheme flopped over ded as fuk and some turd took his ponzi scheme and stuffed it under sams dead horse to stand it up like weekend at bernie’s i struggle to believe this isn’t some sort of strange fictional reality show coming soon on fx
2809,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,how is this legal
2810,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,that’s crazy such shady characters in the crypto industry
2811,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,if justin sun is involved you know it cant be good
2812,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,the biggest question now is whether justin sun will actually follow through with his promise to exchange the trx tokens like he said it could be very possible that he will put out another announcement later saying he ran out of liquidity after making a killing off the ftx users it would be hella illegal but not any more illegal than the current shit
2813,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,still spiked up to  on ftx  or less on other exchanges
2814,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,regulation is not a bad thing for crypto i like crypto i invest in crypto but many here dislike regulating the crypto space while heavy handed regulation would be problematic some amount of regulation and accountability is needed
2815,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,u gotta hand it to them this is really smart absolutely vile sure but smart i suspect losing our humanity and morals will elevate our successes as individuals
2816,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,making money off desperate people is very low
2817,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is just a shitshow as much as i hate them some regulations are needed asap
2818,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i wonder if they think people are really that stupid to not see this throughor they think they can get away with this unpunished
2819,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,y’all really thought justin sun wouldn’t be a douchebag
2820,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so thats how help from justin sun looks like
2821,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is actually ridiculous remind me not to touch tron out of principle
2822,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,fuckin justin sun
2823,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,knew something like this would be happening with justin sun involved
2824,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,anything justin sun related is highly suspect
2825,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,wow  whole world looking at crime in process and us gov cant do nothing just wow
2826,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,wow that is beyond fucked why would any of the people affected by this ever want to get back into crypto after getting fucked like that
2827,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,what is illegal about this
2828,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,if justin scum had any long term vision he would waive the transaction fee apart from the fractional amount it actually costs
2829,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,never thought i see the day i’d say this but gov is right we need crypto regulation this companies and exchanges can’t keep doing shit like this and getting away with it i’d rather pay the taxes on any profits than see this kinda bullshit happen
2830,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this sucks  but what is even more surprising is people are still buying ftt and solana  don’t they read or see any news
2831,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,ftx ponzi scheme ftx was not a ponzi scheme
2832,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,such blatant manipulation before our very eyes
2833,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this whole situation gets shadier by the second wow
2834,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,that is fup if they can do this whats next
2835,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,bunch of scammers
2836,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is really happening what the hell is wrong with these people
2837,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its like theyre trying to hold each others beers on they can fuck up more
2838,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,apparently the legal and compliance team for ftx quitwere fired yesterday so there isnt anyone to advise them on the shit they are doing i am not a lawyer but this is not legaldamn they could have used their help herethis is definitely not illegal but the biggest most piece of shit move you can make as a ceo
2839,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,thai is insane… i guess people are desperate to get their assets out and it seems to be the only way
2840,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,okay but lets say justin sun deposits trx onto ftx and sells it for usd how does he withdraw that usd if all withdrawals are blocked except for  tokens 
2841,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,the screenshot is from the future 🤔
2842,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this just happened to me with sifchain   k to    the swap fee was   of the amount for example rown to atom      with fees  atom  and add to that you were limited to  to  rown swap so it was a hit and miss  that you might get charged the fees but the transaction fails due limitation on the swap  it was a good example of not all dex are dex
2843,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i just image how much money should be there to pay that price to withdraw
2844,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,buttcoin will love this lol
2845,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is what deregulation is
2846,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is wild lol
2847,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,
2848,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,but somehow ftx us is okay or is sbf just lying about that too

2884,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,is this legal
2885,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,  apologies for this long post  but i am just thinking out loud and was wondering if  good lads here could offer perspective on these thoughts    until this point    we ended up bringing in the fiat dollars in the defi ecosystem in other words just spent fiat to buy cryptobut what has a person ended up spending their crypto on  more crypto  different crytpo and some nfts   apart from a few like bitcoin eth  ada  every other coin has been is either a looong term investment with the hope that the project doesnt go bankrupt or you spend really big amount of eth to buy a crypto punk or a bored ape etc as they may sustain a long uncertain future of the defi space  all the tools that have popped up in the crypto space are just becoming an extended ecosystem to aid crypto space  whether through becoming yield aggreagtors parachainsdexeskyc etc etc but where else has one ended up spending the crypto in buying a digital or  a real world asset   how does the word hodl work if the treasury of the small projects that we invested in dry out till  comes to practical implementation     so what does the crypto space have apart from a promise in the future   my guess is a user database with loyalty so what if some small companies which want more eyeballs are reached out and asked to do some kind of product or service promotion in the crytpo space in return the userssubscribers of the crypto projects are asked to do some amount of tweet and gleam style shilling on social platforms and in return with a nominal spend of the crypto  they could purchase a  product or service these companies may have to offer it would be even cooler if couple of projects could join hands to offer a bigger database of user to crack bigger and more formidable deals
2886,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,better to withdraw something than nothing
2887,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,can you buy tron somewhere else and send to ftx
2888,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i was literally a bit scared of defi protocols now im willingly learning how to use them step by step with extra accounts to not mess up but still
2889,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,well id happily pay  cents per trx to get my cash out maybe they should just lock the trx price there and let everyone keep 
2890,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so would it be a play to short tron knowing it is just temporarily spiked
2891,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,you just salty cuz you shorted
2892,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,geez feeling real bad for the folks that got burned on this one
2893,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,can someone explain to me what part of this is illegal not saying it isnt but just curious on the specifics more
2894,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,lol
2895,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its amazing this is not more commonly known
2896,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i have never been a fan of justin sun or tron but this is actually admirable of him not sure why this is a hate thread these people would likely not ever see their money if it wasn’t for this and i see no other leaders stepping up to help
2897,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,someone should rip off that mans head and shit down his neck figuratively of course i do not condone violence
2898,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,it’s funny sometimes i forgot tron even exists then some shady news comes out that involves it and then i remember why i never invested in it
2899,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its like when binance asked me for  dollars to recover 
2900,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,guess this will teach you all never leave your coins sitting on an exchange something that has been stated for more than  years yet dopes keep trusting these exchanges
2901,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is criminal somehow  debt now becomes less than  both sun and sbf benefit from this only customers lost money
2902,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,what does justin sun get out of this he sells all his trx to the users at inflated prices and acquires all the users coins and such but theres none to actually withdraw 
2903,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its sad to see people so desperate to do such things shows how bad actors can ruin lives hopefully we will have trustworthy exchanges in a couple of years but looking at the shenanigans banks have been pulling im not hopeful  better be your own bank then
2904,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,once youre waist deep in shit a few more inches is nothing
2905,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,straightup fraud and nothing else still making money lol an average day in cryptocurrency
2906,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is becoming one helluva story
2907,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,i have never read any news portraying justin sun as not criminal or not pos
2908,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,we… looks like they were smart
2909,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so… mlb umpires won’t be wearing ftx logos next year
2910,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,whenever celebrities who live in lala land in the first place all flock to invest in some bullshit be weary how many times must this happen for people to wake up
2911,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its not like this is benefiting the price of tron on any other exchanges though moving in sync with the rest of the market
2912,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,the entire crypto market is based on fraud and scams and pump and dumps  it gives the illusion you are investing but you are really diversifying your money into many different scams
2913,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,justin sun is insulted by your accusation and maintains that he is only providing a needed customer service
2914,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so someone put a limit order to sell at  and their order was filled
2915,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,wasn’t justin sun something to do with the luna collapse
2916,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,lol you motherfuckers sure know how to debank and defi
2917,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,its too bad so many big names in crypto are such snakes always gotta dyor
2918,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,tron holders with hopeful sell orders all woke up with boners
2919,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,what no regulation does to a mf
2920,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,tron is next that will go to zero
2921,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,justin sun is a criminal and so are all cexes dex is the way
2922,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,ive made my peace with the fact my funds are probably gone
2923,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is such a shitty situation for everyone involved and the crytpo space as a whole
2924,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,they should be in jail sam and kwon
2925,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,dont they have around a quarter of their liabilities but that is of course still a big question mark
2926,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this is so sad to see just horrible
2927,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so theoretically what if you were already holding only tron on ftx lol
2928,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,just like i wrote about this wasstill going on
2929,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,hopefully we can get rid of this asshole too hey if you got to pay to get your own goddamn money off you do what you got to do at this point in time its better than nothing
2930,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,ok so next to go down is tron then not because of bancrupty but because of being banned it many countries and from many exchanges
2931,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,stop gambling on digital illusions  buy physical silver  an ounce the most undervalued commodity in the world rwallstreetsilver
2932,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,crypto is good
2933,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,so basicly said  you cannot print your own tokenmoney and sell it to people and then degrade this tokenmoney but if government is doing the same it is completely normal wake up people d
2934,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,youre looking at the chart wrong thats the alltime view where you only see one green candlespike    check on  daily chartit wouldnt even be possible for such a scheme sun story is just that
2935,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,thats a crazy scam preying on the vulnerable one can only hope somebody looks into suns books next
2936,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,how do we feel about coinbase safe
2937,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,this really isnt as clever as they think it is everyone can see this justin sun just basically got in bed with sbf to commit some crimes after sbf was already in way over his head
2938,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,but bitcoin and self custody decentralization is important
2939,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,talk about getting kicked in the mouth while you’re down and apparently on the way out too total bullshit 
2940,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,only had  in btc on ftx but i successfully transferred it to coinbase for  today trip out on that
2941,yrvdes,2022-11-10 23:40:00,my level of sympathy is somewhere between slim and none literally the first thing you should learn about in crypto is a hardware wallet as the saying goes not your keys not your bitcoin your keys your bitcoin
3258,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,now we know that ftx stands for fck this xchange
3259,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,wait what how do you take funds back
3260,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,you know damn sure your funds wouldn’t be returned from an exchange if you went bankrupt fuck all of this
3261,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,im kinda confused from this do also bahamian users that managed to withdraw before the collapse get their funds taken back or is this only about the sbf party that tried to escape
3262,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,didn’t this guy claim he wanted to donate most of his money to charity since he was young and rich but now has ran off with millions and going into bankruptcy
3263,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,god everyone involved is such a grifter especially justin sun
3264,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,guys this ftx drama is an absolute disaster for all of crypto
3265,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,glad i withdrew on  to my own walletthanks again to all the reddit users who pushed really hard and after the  time reading about it i took it serious and didnt wipe it off as a hysteria in the market thanks guys
3266,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,whenever i think it cant get worse it doesfuck sbf he single handedly took us additional months away from a nice recovery
3267,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,the eternal shitshow that doesnt know how to stop screwing over its victims
3268,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,going to be funny when sbf has a crypto reward placed on his head for prison games
3269,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,how are they ever going to take back funds from users who withdrew what if someone refuses or has transferred to cold wallet or fiat
3270,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,fuck ftx 
3271,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,and this kid ended up on the cover of forbes magazine how were so many people so easily fooled  people complain about undisclosed fees in mutual funds for the love of doug but yet this went on unnoticed nobody asked questions
3272,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,if we gave everyone a million dollars right now a loaf of bread  would be a full days wages
3273,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,as a celsius vet weve been all over this these clawbacks are only likely and necessary for insiders who knew anyone with just a few k that doesnt count as an insider can most assuredly relax these kind of posts are just to scare you
3274,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,if this were me i wouldnt pay even if ordered to until absolutely nessecary fuck ftx id treat it like my  outstanding internet bill from  years ago in college when i didnt return the router they talked a big game but never did anything about it
3275,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i see ledger on this list is this the same as those ledger crypto electronic wallets
3276,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i really do hope those mfuckers suffer the consequences of what they have done to their customers
3277,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,thank god i took my eth off on the 
3278,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,its actually worse than most of us could have imagined its incredible

3280,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,you damn straight the cartels know where every penny goes my man you come up light on a weekend sale and be assured that the  ahem  ceo is going to be asking to see you on monday morning
3281,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,no  checked most of the ftx venture recipients are safe too as they were not completely dependent on them
3282,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i feel so bad for everyone involved
3283,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,crypto can’t be ‘taken back’ that’s the best thing about it
3284,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,so what they can just take users money and use to pay off loans
3285,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,you thought you were safe because you withdrew early if you used ftx you deserve the clawbackget ftxed
3286,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i thought it could even be possible  days prior to the bankruptcy filling but only on ftxus i removed my coins on ftxcom on the  of november it’s all on cold wallet now so i hope to be safe
3287,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,the more i read about this the more it becomes apparent this was a money laundering operation from the start take money from working class people and put clean  into the hands of few powerful people
3288,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,a kids lemonade stand would have better financial oversight than this
3289,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,laughs in cold wallet monero
3290,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,its just going bad for real man but who gives a fuck about that i mean we were just saying that we need a fucking good cold wallet and yeah these things will happen
3291,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,this whole situation keeps one upping itself
3292,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,if anything i would think these people tried to make it seem like they are affiliated with ledger sas
3293,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,doesnt sound like these people actually built ftxdoesnt sound like they actually ran itsounds like they were just bunch of patsies who were enlistedcast to create an image needed to sell the brandsome folks must really hate their kids
3294,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i was told that unregulated business was the best business im not sure how that could have gone wrong
3295,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,lot of problems indeed but to me the biggest issue is who the hell funded a business like that how did they get so much money without anybody saying wait a minute that is what needs to be regulated in my opinion
3296,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,soon ftx will come after its customers private property as well
3297,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,good post op

3320,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,you misheard it’s “if you need regulators to protect you then you’re gonna end up with ftx eventually who was under oversight by the cftc make sure you design a system that doesn’t need them”
3321,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,fuck this is going so fucking bad right now and we dont know what should we do at this point of time with these people this is just fucking bad for real man

3333,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,step  deposit all your customers money with ftx  get millions from  wait for ftx to  the banks and bankman work together to make sure all remaining fiat stays locked up even transferring funds back from people who tried to save themselves at the last minute ensuring it all ends up in the pockets of the guys who took the kickbacks for placing the customer funds with the fraudster in the first place since they will be the largest debtors on file during bankruptcy proceedings  after you get your portion of the final ponzi payout determined by a contest of who defrauded  the most customers leading up to the collapse eerily similar to the “deposit everything here and receive rewards based on deposit ranking” contests binance popularized you then send a message to your depositors explaining that since the payout wasn’t enough to take care of everyone you’re just gonna keep it al i mean “reinvest it into the business in hopes of seeking the best overall outcome for all investors” aw damn i should have mentioned spoiler alert…
3334,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,investors always get screwed always

3357,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i am really don’t understand this but how can they take back the funds only way i can work it out if someone agrees to send funds back and who in the right mind would send anything back to ftx
3358,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,this saga is going to need its own yakety sax theme

3364,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i want to believe that most people affected sent their crypto to a different wallet instead of cashing through ftx at the timei havent used ftx but unless they had any restrictions on moving funds to other wallets thatd definitely be the safest and fastest way to proceed even without the benefit of hindsight
3365,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,that withdrawal would be going to a cold wallet a cold wallet thats about to have itself a boating accident
3366,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,thats really messed up they keep finding ways to screw people

3397,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,pretty sure those tweets are not about the clawbacks and are instead about the funds that were suddenly transferred from the ftx and ftxus wallets because of a “hack” insider more likely these past two days the hacker has been dumping the stolen funds i took the timing of the tweets to refer to the fact that the hacker was on the move yesterday and today moving the stolen crypto
3398,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,ftx reminds me of the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs
3399,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,god just when you think crypto is actually good… big gov steps in… yeah somethjng tells me in  years governments will control crypto

3406,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,i thought a transaction was a transaction  irreversible if unwanted isn’t that the whole idea of decentralization
3407,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,how can you get funds back that were transferred out of the chain
3408,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,bahamiam government laughs in money
3409,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,this is why so many of us are anti kyc and shit services like plaid that can see your banking history cant clawback if you dont know who has it
3410,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,wait if you withdrew from the exchange and put your coins in a hardware wallet or something akin how exactly do they plan on getting them back
3411,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,wow a lot of people in this thread clearly didnt do their own research on what happens in pretty much every bankruptcy including the cryptorelated bankruptcies that already made news within the past six months very savvy investment class we have here
3412,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,wait isn’t this post misleading  i’m pretty sure they are referring to the eth hacker that dumped stolen ftx eth on the marketthe tweet also came out exactly a couple minutes after the blackhat started dumping yesterday
3413,z0w281,2022-11-21 10:55:43,ftx will pull a mt gox and dump its crypto onto the market to settle bankruptcy proceedings get ready for a bear market lmao

4308,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,“the unaudited balance sheet provided as of sep  before the collapse for ftx us stated total assetsworth  billion if this is accurate at least ftx ushas more than enough to cover at least the fiatdeposits not crypto of its customers”
4309,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,heard about this this morning on talk radio its so freaking pathetic

4318,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,and they managed to do it because all of you plonkers used their exchange
4319,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,paragraph  is an interesting one  the debtors have engaged forensic analysts to identify potential debtor assets on the blockchainnot sure how theyd get it back but theyd definitely do what they can its not like stealing a poor mans funds sbf and the likes fucked over big moneyof course those on ftx wont be paid back first it will likely be all the big players who loaned to them etc

4339,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i remember watching an interview like a year or two ago on bloomberg i think where this fuzzy neck beard weird looking dude came out and said a bunch of nonsense literally looked like a kid giving a book report that didn’t read the book to a group of people who thought he must shit golden nuggets i couldn’t actually believe that the fuzz ball with a stained haines tshirt sitting in a circle of suits was some kind of financial genius that was going to disrupt finance forever and he wasn’t doing a stunningly good job interviewing and it wasn’t that he was just being anxious they’d ask a question he’d give a half hearted incomplete answer and they’d just roll on like it was satisfactory then they mentioned dude had some number of billions of dollars under management…… i was pretty much floored i try to keep an open mind especially kn this space but absolutely nothing was adding up in my head glad i stayed the fuck away
4340,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,im still trying to figure out the moral of this  people are  we are living in the epoch of idiocracy

4360,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,elon’s looking better and better every day
4361,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,do kwon sbf who will complete the criminal trifecta this year im hoping elon
4362,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,how much went from congress — ukraine — ftx — congresshmmmm
4363,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,how much of this is just covering up all the corruption that was happening with others that were involved in all this like the government  i feel like this is really just those that really are guilty higher up on the world power list trying to put the blame on the former ceos to hide all the other higher up players in this lol
4364,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,it was clearly a money laundering operation for ukraine and democrats
4365,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,can anyone explain how they could do this without any kind of control from outside while everyone else was attacked and kyc bs all over and many cex where closed because of being to unsecure many international ones where attacked luna was attacked solana whole network was crashed by alameda bots countless times just to trigger liquidations on ftx this fking idiot sbf could not do this alone and my gut and all i read and saw in the past tells me that ftx was used by gov and big banks as an infiltration point in crypto markets and was used to destabilize and destroy the markets when they gone up and finance other operations because financing anything with crypto is ridiculously simple there is a way bigger world out there then centralized exchanges
4366,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,why am i getting a feeling that all this was premeditated big banks wanted people to lose interest and faith in crypto  they get sbf and friends to do this for them in exchange of billions and to make it worst the banks are not paying sbf and friends the billions the crypto community did  for them it was a win win situation
4367,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this is what i was commenting about yesterday no organization at all
4368,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,you couldnt even make this shit up

4380,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sbf is a  peice of garbage using investors money like that hope he gets what he deserves
4381,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,itll get worse
4382,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,wheres the porn
4383,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,lets not assume that fear of perjury somehow scares a guy this connectedrich but yes this is pretty fucked uplook forward to the tough on crime district attorney that works out a deal with sbf for like eight grand in civil penalties as the extent of where this case goes
4384,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,idk why the dude is not yet in jail
4385,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,wow just wow

4390,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i don’t think i’ve seen this post yet
4391,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this was actually a political operation on a great scale they will find nothing
4392,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this does wonders for cryptos reputation
4393,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i would just like to say that i feel sorry for anyone who lost money in this scam but as a connoisseur of drama this is just amazing the elon and twitter sideshow was gold but this is next level you cannot make this shit up
4394,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,if committed intentionally  helps govt regulate crypto  gives them the pretense to attempt to regulate crypto can’t figure out if he was setup knew all along or cz binance just crushed his dim witted competitor… maybe all of the above
4395,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,he did some next level crimes seriously shocking
4396,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,almost as if…it was done intentionally
4397,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,how can this be worse then i thought when i was thinking total disaster
4398,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,all in all it does look like sbf knew what he was doing and did everything from not keeping records autodeleting messages and backdoor access to avoid getting caught this ones going into the history bookssounds to me like sbf knew exactly what he was doing he didnt need records if he had no intention of making everyone square auto deleting messages so that there is no paper trail to show actual felonies i mean they didnt even have a full list of employees how more obvious does it need to be that sbf was not running a business this was a scam pure and simple
4399,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,im thinking of buying an industrial popcorn machine
4400,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,where can i find the tss report
4401,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,tbh the scale audacity and impact of this should see him executed for these crimes
4402,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,hey fed you see what happens when you print  dollars jackasses like this somehow get their hands on  of it and lose it all
4403,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i remember when everybody was amazed those guys from alameda were so good at what they did  liquidating shorts and longs and whatnotman i hope that hairy wig ass hoobit looking motherfucker did enjoy his time with orgies and shit cos i truly  truly  truly hope he fucked somebody wealthy up so he and his friends can end up in jail
4404,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32, expense reports were approved by emojis over chat🤯

4407,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,so when he mentions that armanio llp audited ftxthey also do nexo is he stating that they are reputable and didnt catch the problems or is he instead saying the audit firm that has an office in decentralnad is a farce
4408,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,breathtaking criminality
4409,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,jesus this makes celsius look like they had a triple a business plan
4410,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,how does something like this happen
4411,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,all intentional no surprises but a pretty telling tale that will be an example forever
4412,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i cant wait for the impending documentary
4413,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,how could they keep this charade for so long

4415,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,that is shockingly bad the make enron management look competent i’ll be honest one of the reasons i wouldn’t go near ftx was sbf he’s scruffy unprofessional looking has an irritating voice and i had a gut feeling something didn’t sit right with me but i couldn’t put my finger in it at the time so kept away little did i know he was a self serving arsehole with no morals and nothing more than a common thief its disgusting that the lot of them are still not locked away in prison permanently but i doubt it’s going to happen far too many connections in high places including law akers to get him off the hook
4416,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sure they will end up in cock heaven prison
4417,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,it’s shit because it was basically a big scam ran under the premise of being a business one of the largest thefts in history
4418,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,the company was their personal piggy bank
4419,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,giancarlo hold my beer

4422,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,ftx was set up to launder money
4423,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,whats been left unsaid is if some russian mafia types or drug cartels may have put their money into ftx and may as consequence prefer to take a more direct action with sbf and other ftx principals
4424,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,lock him and his ugly ass girlfriend up already wtf are they waiting for
4425,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this is a freking gong show

4429,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,wen sbf  caroline sex tape tho
4430,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,what was sbf’s goal with all this subterfuge i’m thinking the whole nonmaterialistic altruism thing was an act and he wanted to make it easy to siphon off cash to alameda to gamble with
4431,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,imagine running a  employee company on snapchati guess with ftx we dont have to imaginesob
4432,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,death penalty
4433,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,somehow it gets worst everyday
4434,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32, is behind the “hack”
4435,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,jeezuz some people really have no friends
4436,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,people trusted them and unfortunately ftx was treated as a personal bank account sounds like it could’ve been run better with headless chickens
4437,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,so  worth of solana should be dumped within the day did i get that right
4438,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,dose anyone have  that “link” asking for a friend

4440,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,proper horror reality
4441,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,big question here is what big crime takes for people to go to prison in terms of monetary fraud
4442,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sbf will probably get bugger all as he’s served his purpose  to give crypto a bad name so the government can swoop in and rescue the day by tighter regulations and cbdc’s i don’t believe for a second that no regulators were aware of what was going on i mean take one look at alamedas ceo and you gotta ask yourself  “hold on a fucking second”
4443,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,it’s in his name “bank man fried” he certainly will be
4444,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i got into it with some folks this week about the fact that audit is not the silver bullet that would expose crooks it’s backwards facing and relies on the competence of the auditor and the scope of the audit to be effective in corrupt institutions when they are paying for their own audit it’s common for them to pass audits with flying colors — only to later implode due to things that should have been caught in an auditso let’s be aware that audit isn’t the smoking gun solution to ftx and others though it is part of the solution that will eventually emergealso be aware that the frankdodd act which was basically set up to keep this exact set of circumstances from happening in banking — and i’m thinking specifically of securitybased swaps like creditdefault swaps to be cleared in an exchange or clearinghouse — is likely to be the model for crypto regulation moving forwardthis means licensing and regulatory oversite for exchangesjust bear it in mind
4445,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,they were mit nerds but they werent high stakes traders they were bound to lose it all eventually with the amount of risk they were taking
4446,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sounds like they never planned for it to be a sustainable exchange…
4447,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,netflix documentary soon
4448,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,wtf  had to check if i missed the comedy flair even did a search to verify  it checks out
4449,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,what if the powers that be needed a catalyst for market cap suppression to properly enter a space that they in their mind rightfully should control  funding ftx through the backchannels with the intent that it would implode after achieving a  status in the space might provide that opportunity  where did sbfs seed funding originate from  they worked hard to cover their tracks in the execution of their business model  it seems like a trojan horse operation that workeda little too well  so well in fact that it garnered more attention then they anticipatedthey offloaded their btc starting in june after the luna implosion and nobody noticed  they held  bitcoin before it collapsed  no exchange that trades crypto could seriously expect this to work give a child a lighter and watch him burn down his own house so you can rebuild on the ashes for pennies on the dollarill take off my tinfoil hat now and say naw just a bunch of idiots running around with their heads cut offi think we should keep in mind that this was just the initial blow forced regulation was the real intent  your alt coins are all in danger of dropping by large s when the us government steps in
4450,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,these guys and girls shall be maken example of under the rule of law especially sam he would connect to his inner self without league of legends and his razer laptop
4451,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this is enron on steroids a lot of the same type shit but wayyyy dumber
4452,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,all to make crypto look bad complete wild wild west shit
4453,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sounds like crypto in a nutshell people losing millions of dollars every day on obvious scams
4454,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,from weird looking billionaire to a weird looking federal prison inmate

4462,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sbf needs some torture in his life
4463,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,of course sbf knew exactly what he was doing  all conmen do  i chalk it up to ego arrogance lack of compass as to why someone would run a business like this
4464,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,how the hell do you even know whats going on yourself at your company if you delete all records he must have had them backed up somewhere
4465,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,never mind jail how are any of these clowns still alive
4466,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i dont get how can someone be so rich and so stupid at the same time
4467,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this makes me wonder about coinbase i have a little money there and if this ftx thing is the way these crypto brokers do things i better withdraw all my money pronto
4468,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,you’re telling me guys were getting expenses approved with a smiley face like my  grade book report
4469,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,sbf’s parents are lawyers he was intentionally committing fraud from the very beginning based on how he structured and ran the company

4480,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,ive googled in the past enron how they did it etc all vague anyone have more details of their actual play book asking for a friend
4481,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,based on the new info it is very obvious that we need regulation it is pretty clear at this time that very  few have ethics and live by honormoney blinds them
4482,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,thx for sharing
4483,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,surely you dont think this is unique situation for crypto companies
4484,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,im the general sales manager of a decent sized chevrolet dealership i have to wonder what the ftc’s stance is on this improper record keeping of this nature would put myself in prison for decades
4485,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,this guys got a bounty on his head
4486,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,whole thing smells like it was set up to perform a certain job washing monies for someone or some people
4487,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,the craziest take away for me from that deposition they didn’t have an accounting department they outsourced their accounting a ten billion dollar company doesn’t outsource accounting but a ten billion dollar ponzi doesn’t care about accounting
4488,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,they didn’t even know if they had fake employees…
4489,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,well no wonder why i couldnt get an account where i live a single look at one of these would blacklist them
4490,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,waitthe guy from enron says he has never seen anything this bad  uhhhhh ok
4491,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,that’s what happens in an unregulated market it’s actually not surprising
4492,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,smoke and mirrors  make an easy to use platform doesnt matter what is behind it  one of the same people that called it a safe platform publicly also is one of five that may decide on ur lifelong dream invention lol
4493,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,not surprise of seeing alameda again on a mayor scam
4494,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,i guess we know why biance was all like umno can you imagine hoping to dump these kind of issues in someone elses lap and then walk away smelling like roses
4495,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,thats what you get when you let a dude who looks like a hobo and cliche ugly nerd sitcom girl run a exchangewhy would anyone trust a fucking dude that lives like he doesent take care of himself lmao
4496,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,they were king of corruption im really amazed how investors were trusting them interpol must step in and put everyone in jail including the employees
4497,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,just wow
4498,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,it’s obvious regulations are needed given the chance even the softest dork is going to screw people over if that kills crypto then so be it i guess
4499,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,as an aside john ray’s career seems interesting as hell
4500,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,happens when the let kids handle this
4501,yyocvb,2022-11-18 16:36:32,if they are not going to jail then…

4830,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,you completely missed the sarcasm on most of those articlesfrom the reuterscalled sbf a curly hair kingpin one you postedas the financial stability board pointed out last week crypto exchanges have evolved to offer trading in digital coins as well as clearing settlement lending custody and brokerage services few mainstream financial firms would be allowed to combine such a range of activities many crypto platforms also invest in their rivals another regulatory taboodyor

4832,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,we gonna call out the msm news bias but not yours take each of these articles one by one and also actually read them also you have to remember not everyone outside of crypto including journalists will have this same “sbf is the most evil guy in the world” sentiment most people are clueless and don’t know the atmosphere within crypto about him  washington post one prob worst of the three here this article is clearly meant to highlight the different pandemic related orgs that sbf donated to this article isn’t all positive if you read it they called him “politically naive” compare him to “elizabeth holmes” and also suggest he did all this to gain favor among politicians they also do say he went bankrupt because of misuse of customer funds but like i said the article itself is in the “health” section so tries to focus on the different pandemic orgs and what they  the reuters price misleading title but from what i gathered reading the whole article the writer is like super anti crypto and is saying sbfs situation does tradfi a favor by wrecking crypto he talks about how it will affect the legitimacy of crypto which he thinks is a good  forbes when i saw the original title for this article i though here we go again another puff piece like the nyt did for sbf if you read it though it actually goes pretty accurately on what’s been known yes they spend maybe too much talking about her academic life and upbringing but they hit on all the things caroline is suspected of just because they use “math whiz” and such words doesn’t mean they ignore calling out her crime and also her failingsstupidityconclusion it’s really easy to read these titles and be like “msm bad he donated to dems so it must mean every news site is gonna write to make him look good” but that’s just a naive take i’ve seen articles from the same site where one writer writes one way but a diff one writes different way also like some of these articles are “commentary” articles and not “news” articles which a lot of you can’t seem to tell apart and also like this entire post literally sounds to me like op only read the titles and not the actual articlesps i do think there are lots of shittybiased msm articles on this topic just these examples were bad choices due to clear lack of actual reading or understanding of the articles
4833,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,they are all bought out

4860,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,it is a complete joke but it is to be expected mainstream media are hip to hip with the political parties and they both want to keep the status quo keep the population stupid and line their own pockets this is why crypto is so dangerous to them because by its nature is can be decentralised
4861,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,you can get away with being the biggest piece of shit around as long as you give money to the right people
4862,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,the fact people are expecting the media to be ashamed of doing their masters works is hilarious first time really
4863,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,honestly i was expecting better from them like why the fall of ftx is a sign of toxic whiteness and patriarchy or something
4864,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,i like how forbes edited the picture to make her look more likeable

4873,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,note reuters article is not praising sbf but instead claiming that the fall of ftx had the double whammy of taking sbf who was trying to lead regulation on his own terms out of the equation while simultaneously accelerating said regulation the article did not praise or forgive sbf in any way now whether you believe regulation for crypto is a good thing or not is up to you
4874,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,they should be ashamedthats unfortunately not going to happen because they are shameless

4884,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,why donated funds arent recalled to pay off some debts are beyond me
4885,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30, reuters about the ftxcollapse now here we do not even have to go further and can see that the headline of this reuters article is already trying to really make a billiondollar scam to fill his own pockets look like a “favour“you clearly didnt read the articleits about how his fraudulent criminal activities are making people not want to legitimize the scam zone that is cryptothe favor is making people stop looking at crypto favorablywhich is good because crypto is a scam

4894,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,none of those articles are very flattering and the ones you didn’t cherry pick are even less flattering conspiracy nut
4895,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,it is clear that the media must have been paid by sbf to write such “shillarticles“ about him and his companieshold on a second partnerin order for it to be clear you need to have evidence and not just speculation  you can say you believe they were paid but you cant state something is true unless you have evidence
4896,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,this is a ridiculous failed attempt to politicize this matter sam bankman fried and ftx also donated to republicans this is a very common practice unfortunately rich donate to both parties in a political racehere you go fox news story not a woke media outlet  there are public records showing the amounts donated to republican political parties in  
4897,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,tale as old as time   decides the winners and the losers

4907,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,if you look back throughout your life with a critical eye you will find the media has always been there to shape the perception of the general public not to educate or inform them  it wasnt always this way but until enough people are aware of it it will continue
4908,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,this is why institutions shouldn’t be allowed to fund politicians  the corruption will never end due to money
4909,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,im surprised that no one who lost big money has snapped and tried to kill himjohn lennon died for less

4983,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,arthur hayes wrote a good piece on this and tldr is that sbf and his cronies represent the upper echelon of the us caste system and are therefore being protected by the status quo

5005,z0acqz,2022-11-20 17:48:30,they are investigating themselves to declare themselves innocent again

5340,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin oleary has always been an entitled dummy  he thinks hes smarter than everyone bc he has money
5341,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i met…i met…i met…i didn’t ask for financials…
5342,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he is saying what he needs to say to minimize liability from his shills while trying to keep peace with sbf its a planned piece much like how the politicians operate
5343,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,almeada lost  billion something in  when almost every coin was giving returns in the multiples the only reason they got so big so fast is cause they are well connected from the start the mother of sbf is a lobbyist and has connections to people in higher positions
5344,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i dont know of a more productive and efficient for a while anyways traitor of cryptofixededit watching the video further  lol interesting
5345,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,guess someones still holding to a bag of ftt
5346,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin was a paid spokesperson for ftx somewhere in his little brain hes figured out that hes better off backing scammin sammy at this point vs turning on himits a little like the time his boat hit and killed someone while his wife was operating the boat
5347,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin will make money on ftx on the way up the way down and the way back up  you don’t know the deals this guy gets he plays by different rules
5348,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,oh theres a lot more people in crypto that are more stupid than him
5349,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,the crime of the centurysam even went to get advice from the cop on the beat to  make sure he was crossing his tees and dotting his is  thats what the sec is for to help the elite scam the peasants  look at the big picture under top cop on the beat  giving bullshit fines to celebrities and suing well run companies  all the while letting the real scammers crush retail investorswhat a fkn joke he is the us govt is totally corrupt from top to bottom all for the rich non for the poor
5350,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he follows the money doesnt mean hes educated on the areas in which the money flows
5351,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin is as fake as you can get i stopped listening to this clown years ago
5352,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i wonder if he is saying that because sbf was prob giving him some inside trader information or allowing him to borrow against the customer funds as well just theory
5353,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,it seems like there is likely more at play he doesn’t necessarily seem the type to be that stupid granted he is full of himself but normally able to see things more clearly than what he is doing with sbf likely he has a lot of money on the line and would benefit from sbf being able to recover somehow
5354,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,the only reason kevin is okay with a thief who stole billions from people who trusted him is because kevin is also one
5355,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin wants first dibs getting money hes owed from sbf once hes paid hell shit on sbf right now he has to lick ass to get his money
5356,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,remember the time kevin and his wife were wasted operating their boat and killed two people and got away with it yeah doesnt surprise me he is cool with sbf
5357,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin o’leary is a scummy business man thst doesn’t care about anything but money  the man is a psycho path
5358,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he isnt stupid he is just playing his role you guys need to understand many of these faces you see are puppets stop being naive and assuming they are all independent agents
5359,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,just going to say that fuck these people man they are wrong for most of us and we are here to do some good things for ourselves man this is going like that right now
5360,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,where are the  posts under  one yt sicks amazing how they lost respect for the  amd
5361,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin wants everyone to put money back in so he can recoupe his losses thats why hes preaching
5362,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,wtf he almost praised him disciplined really wow he wants him on his team  rflmao   wow
5363,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,yall are hilarious thanks for replying to my comment cheers
5364,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,not sure if thats much of a penance as both would have too much fun together if you know what i mean
5365,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he was in on it and sbf warned him rat me out i rat you out so obvious
5366,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,they say you cant buy loyalty……turn out you can they were just not aware of the price
5367,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,not all good investors of companies really can handle crypto
5368,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he is talking about regulation a lotat the end ends up getting crypto exposure from cexes instead of owning crypto totally missed the point
5369,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,its more likely the person who cant stop worshipping or shit flinging famous people
5370,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,money is the strongest bridge
5371,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes paid what did you expect
5372,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,him and bitboy would probably get along just fine
5373,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,because they are both corrupt pieces of shit and they’re going to back him because if his shit gets exposed the big o is gonna get fucked with him
5374,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s way under their thumb at this point
5375,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin was most likely paid for his endorsement and given the shares of the company for his endorsement
5376,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he knows him personally and his comments are based on that not as a customer and not just as a person in the internet
5377,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s talking a lot lately about crypto related topics and i’m starting to get tired of listening to him to be honest he’s not relevant
5378,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s just saying that because he lost his ass on ftx and sol
5379,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,not just crypto he’s the stupidest person in general but he’s quite entertaining
5380,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,when this man ran for the conservative party of canadas leadership i knew that he did not know how people worked neither individuals or larger populations
5381,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,because sbf is a great trader apparently the fact that he completely lacks ethics or common sense doesnt matter
5382,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,something feels shady about this entire thing does sbf have dirt on all his “supporters” are intelligence agencies involved
5383,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,lets set up an inverse oleary indicator when he shills something its time to dump it
5384,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i don’t listen to him in any way shape or form sbf sure “donated” to the right people to get this preferential treatment wsj recent piece was disgusting
5385,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,can we please stop giving canadian trump attention were better than this
5386,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,idk i think cuban still takes the cake for dumbest
5387,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin o learly only sees 
5388,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes not stupid hes in bed with ftx too
5389,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,whats kevins company so that i can short his stocklong puts on it
5390,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes not necessarily dumb it just goes to show how all these rich folks are all buddy buddies with each other and theyre just speaking up for their other buddy its a sick and fucked up system
5391,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,maybe he’s hoping sbf can side door him his investment
5392,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,what’s not being discussed in the comments section is what’s going on behind the scenes i believe he is a paid spokesperson for ftx and so he is obligated to not speak ill of the company or risk losing even more money for breach of contract if not there are only two other reasons i can think and that’s to not get into legal liability andor hoping he recovers his money by not trashing the company
5393,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,sbf has all the receipts 🧾or maybe a sloppy spreadsheet of everyone on his payroll  if they’re saying nice things about him they’re on it
5394,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,the rich protect their own their echelon probably stupid to but kevin is a business man morals be damned the single question is can they make money with him again did kevin lose money or did he profit from the venture
5395,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes not stupid  hes a scam artist trying to influence people
5396,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s the biggest clown on the whole internet
5397,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i am just good without thinking about them right now man this is just what the best shit to do and we all know what is good about this shit we are just good with it
5398,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i can understand this one man this is just right to say and we all know why we are being like that right now we are good with thinking like this right now so yeah
5399,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,if you have money invested in kevins company you should exit asapwhat companyhe has a bunch of private investments  like ftx  which he is trying to make moon shots on but unless im mistaken he has no publicly traded companies his fund company  which i dont even think was publicly traded  basically fell apart and got sold offthe guy is always has been and and always will be a hype man never buy anything from him not a car not a lawnmower not a used dinner tablehe is unabashedly a self promotor of the highest order not hating on him but he is what he is 
5400,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,the dude early  was im shorting airlines im long on docusign zoom      he is a fkin clown

5403,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,damn mark cuban held that title for a while now
5404,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i haven’t taken this guy seriously ever since i learned what he’s worth and he’s still bald also he tried to convince everyone to get rid of their cars and not buy one again because it’s a depreciating asset
5405,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,after watching a number of interviews with oleary ive always got the vibe hes the type of guy that waffs his farts and always rates them  just something not right with the guy
5406,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,this guy is an idiot and i wouldn’t doubt he was driving the boat that killed those people not his wife  i bet he had wine
5407,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,why the fuck should anyone listen to him this is whats wrong with people listening to random dudes saying bullshit and thinking its true
5408,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin oleary is a fraud hes part of the deep state cult banking fraudsters
5409,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,respectfully disagree

5411,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin oleary is like the dumb trump of shark tank and should only be referenced for entertainment and never business advice his first advice for anything is to move the manufacturing to china only to be copied cloned and undercut the original dumb and shortsighted right from the rip so listening to his business advice for your own gain is stupid at best
5412,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin is stupid period you guys should understand that in life you might get lucky and become “successful” and it happens to soooooo many people… and then all you have to do is maintain a good image to tell people hey i’m an expert and get paid to speak on tv … that’s what this guy is doing
5413,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,that title belongs to mike saylor my friendthe undisputed king of stupidity
5414,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,you don’t need to listen to the interview to know how stupid he is i watch shark tank and i hate this guy

5418,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i want to think hes dumb but at the same time i feel like he might be reacting this way because of how much he invested in ftxhes clearly only in crypto for the money though he doesnt really share our values
5419,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hmm
5420,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,oleary needs to fuck off he was once a advocate for everyday people to learn business and investing in order to grown wealth and improve their life but he has become a total sellout and shill for anyone who wants to pay him the last few years
5421,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,that…that…is a very bold statement
5422,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin has wonderfi in canada and they keep acquiring canadian exchanges i think they wven have a defi app idk  he thinks hes a big wheel in crypto now

5424,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,ok
5425,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,ignorant salty take op they were printing money but also took on massive risk their meteoric rise and expansion is proof
5426,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,its that effective altruism cult
5427,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he is not exactly stupid he took part in the shilling plan and got money for it
5428,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s both invested and arrogant
5429,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevins not being an idiot here  hes a doing his job remember he said hes a paid spokesperson for ftx and b staying in good graces for some off chance that keeps him at the front of the line for creditor payouts at the end of bankruptcy proceedings self serving sure stupid no
5430,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,might be definitely is at least one of the stupidest definitely in it for himself and not to help anyone else never trust this man
5431,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes just a smaller sbf
5432,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,never heard of him somehow i have a remarkable ability to never even know about all the moronic crypto “influencers”
5433,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,free speech but it seems that listening is going to cost you
5434,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,another one makes the list
5435,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he lost pretty much all credibility with this fiasco
5436,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he just want his money backhe doesnt care which dick to suck next unless hes paid for it
5437,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,the competition for that position is pretty strong lately
5438,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin is a part of rugging society of sbf
5439,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he doesnt even wear pants when we goes on crypto interviews sometimes he pans the camera over to show that he is in his underwear he is playing the entire industry for fools
5440,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,his wife killed  people drunk driving on a boat and faced no consequences he was there too 
5441,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,how much  did kol lose investing in ftx
5442,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he is a rich pos people need to stop listening to this self centred asshole who has zero empathy
5443,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,yes but he’s one of the few powerful voices in washington lobbying for regulation and policy on crypto it’s something we need obviously or crypto will go to zero
5444,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,
5445,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,who the fuck is kevin oleary
5446,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,this wanker and that other helmet marc cubantwo giant turds in the punchbowlexactly not what the scene required
5447,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s in so deep he’s stuck backing a dead horse dude’s freebasing the hopium
5448,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,him defending spf makes sense if you think there was a chance kevin was aware of some of the shady stuff spf was doing in which case its in his interests to defend spf
5449,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes anything but stupid hes just up to his neck in scandal and has no choice but to back sbfhis wife was charged and let off for a boating accident a few years ago that killed two people there are rumours doing the rounds that kevin was the one who was actually driving it at the time
5450,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i’m glad sbf robbed the money…without him more republicans would have won he helped save democracy through thievery
5451,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,say what you will about schiff but the time he called mr wonderful instead mr delusional was hysterical
5452,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,all he did wrong was to scam his customers lmao
5453,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,its just lip service to keep the plebs in while they dump over december
5454,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,for a guy who seems to be business savvy ive seen him say some really really really dumb shit he thought the pilgrims came to america to enjoy capitalism
5455,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin o’leary would kill your mother if it made him a buck
5456,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,op is just mad that they have nothing they care enough for that would make them simp for something as much as kol is simping for some sweet sweet billionairebussy
5457,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he looks like he is dying now
5458,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin o leary is the next jeffrey epstein

5463,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hes not stupid hes saying what he is paid to thats pretty smart though unethical if you ask me
5464,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,since he said he would happily invest in ftx  i really cannot take him seriously
5465,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,“thank you sam may i have another”  o’leary his bitch
5466,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,with the help of crypto im seeing so many real faces of the rich that i just hate every one of them now
5467,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,shark tank episode    kevin o’leary what have you got for us today johnathan    johnathan well mr o’lear—    kevin o’leary call me mr wonderful    johnathan okay mr wonderful i’ve invented a device which allows you to selfcustody all of your digital assets i call it a cold wallet it’s highly secure airgapped and—    kevin o’leary johnathan i’m going to go ahead and stop you right there i’m out this idea sounds dumb to me i mean selfcustody cold wallet who would ever use it i certainly wouldn’t i’m gonna pass
5468,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i dont know whos this guy but the stupidest person in crypto is a very tight competition with thousdans of people on it
5469,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36, wonderful will shoot down your dragons den pitch only to reverse engineer your company the next day
5470,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he was actually around praising bitcoin in  and then did a  starting around  always assumed he was shitting on bitcoin all the time because he wanted to accumulate more at lower prices and believed he was just being a shrewd businessman playing the sentiment for his own gainnow i know hes just a total clown
5471,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i dont understand why people listen to anything kevin oleary says to begin with you know you can literally hire him to say anything you want about your shit company for like  usd right  guy is basically an actor
5472,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he’s not delusional he just has a coi he’s and adviser and is compensated
5473,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i mean he does cameos to promote literal scams destroying his reputation for a quick buck probably shows how stupid he is
5474,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,mr wonderful
5475,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i dont think hes delusional he just doesnt care because he doesnt really have skin the game like average folks what i mean is if his crypto assets go to zero hes still a very rich man
5476,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,their is many times i really  really hate mr wonderful this is one of them and not because of how currency works many people dont understand how crytpo currency works  and how it compares and how it works similar to the currency markets and is based on it    if people were to use this train of thought they might have some better luck with cryptos
5477,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,you better have incredible weight behind any claim of the stupidest person in crypto when theres so much competition
5478,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,so what youre saying is that he fits right in
5479,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,maybe not stupid but may be into some of the dubious shit too so by helping sbf he helps himself
5480,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin is a paid promoter of ftx of course he is gonna suck sbf off
5481,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin o’leary is not the stupidest person in crypto he is a paid spokesman who would have said anything for money and continues to say anything for money
5482,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,one thing kevin has shown us over the years is that he’s a liar he’s working an angle currently one thing he is not is stupid
5483,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36, tradfi people leaving crypto forever hooray crypto bull market hooraychoose one
5484,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin o’leary is a slimey fucking sociopath that’s why he likes sbf
5485,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,not to dispute kevin olearys competence but the dude is literally a paid shill hes under contract to promote ftx and sbf and ftxs filing for bankruptcy doesnt release him from that contract his private feelings on the matter probably dont reflect the public comments he makes
5486,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,nothing is going to be changed and we all can see shits in that way right now man hope you will understand why we are saying shits in that way right now sorry
5487,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,kevin oleary is a scammer and will do anything to make money
5488,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i like how the captions spelled it “traitor” whenever kevin was calling sbf a “genius trader”
5489,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,did you really just say in the same title that we should all listen to an interview if the stupidest person in crypto why would anyone subject themselves to this why do people share things with others that they hate or think are stupid why give them free promotion
5490,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,its because he made money with the scheme
5491,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he is telling you what is happening  kevin  sbf’s understanding of millions and billions is the same as the rest of us referring to s and ¢s  mummy daddy and whoever else sat in on this initial meeting  feck me this boy is a test tube baby that appears to have been created specifically for this purpose   time to be suicided me thinks  right in front of a global audience that would fit the narrative to a tee  created by the same psychopaths that extinguish you is a fate that we may all befall if we don’t cop on pretty effing quickly  fucking patsy for the establishment
5492,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,hard to say honestly at least until i belong to the crypto world as well it is
5493,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,mr wonderfullofshit
5494,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,pretending to be stupid so that people think you are not malicious or fraudulent is an effective strategy helps prevent lawsuits and arrests because you convinced people you are a village idiot
5495,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,what did raoul pal do
5496,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,one nugget of truth at  there were real conversations happening to sell ftx and plug the hole this has been confirmed by multiple sources in spite of the fraud the exchange itself was a good product and there were investors willing to put money in to plug the hole likely to get exchange users  on the  or more of their money backgensler blew up all of these potential deals by going on tv and saying ftx was significantly noncompliant and basically that the sec was going to bring the hammer down now anywho who had assets on ftx will be lucky to see  on the  many many years from now its important to remember goldman garys role in all of this  
5497,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i agree with you saying that sbf is a  is just rationalization to excuse that fact that he got buffaloed
5498,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,well just ignore these people man they are just stupid and nothing more than that and we all can say that most of the time they are just fucking wrong lol

5504,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,he was a “brilliant” because he sees the trades on both sides he used customer funds leveraged it and took the opposite trade of course he’s brilliant he owned the gameexchangebankroll and data completely illegal
5505,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,yeah lost a lot of respect for him because of this

5520,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,well saying that sbf is a crook would mean that dear old kevin fell for a crook he cant accept that

5526,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,i knew a couple weeks ago when i saw his ftx advert piece  my thought was how can this dude call himself mr wonderful and be so cocksure on shark tank then go on an ftx ad and just sound like a complete and total moron  it was just more confirmation for me on how celebrities politicians and the media are just full of shit about everything just like real people

5539,z6lo6h,2022-11-28 03:37:36,this says more about kevin than sbf its truly staggering to hear kevin call sbf brilliant nobody quite like him and doesnt have a evil bone in his body and then for kevin to go on and say that if sbf doesnt get involved in a bad situation personally then he will be found somewhere else in crypto and he would be willing to put sbf on his team am i wrong or does that sound delusional

5946,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,id go even further and say they are nobodys friends probably such people have usually been estranged to normal human interactions for a long time due to the nature and dynamics of their work and ambition furthermore they tend to be surrounded by yesmen gold diggers partners advisors investors competitors and attention whores none of which are really friend material not having friends makes them even more dangerous as they lose their ties to the normal world and empathy

5961,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,of course they’re not but they and their actions both create and shape markets and are therefore worth paying some level of attention to
5962,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,billionaire are not your friends that hit hard
5963,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,sbf is fucked and rightfully so he was trying to get some lawsresolutions passed which would make kyc mandatory in the us and dex would have been outlawedi didnt like the way sbf was screwed over by cz but i aint grieving for him either
5964,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,people in the crypto spheres tendency to praise billionaires and vote conservative incentives me to never talk about bitcoin from a tech level or anything xx
5965,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,no one is really your friend youd be surprised how many people you consider family can stab you in the back for a little money
5966,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,i dont think most people seriously like them anyway its like the wolf of wallstreet guy nobody seriously likes him except the small demographic of people with a mental disposition like many people from rwallstreetbets  i ironically act like hes a hero of mine however he will always be the guy that stole money from people by breaking the law hes nothing more than a con artist still i pretend hes a hero of mine because i love the movie and its funny elon musk i think is no different for most people too he isnt funny but we act like he is hes terrible at business but we pretend hes the next steve jobs i dont think many people that echos how great he is like i do mean it unironically its not like politics where personal identities are involved its just a trustfund baby that isnt at good as business as his slave owning daddy

5968,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53, billionaires could team up and literally end logistics crisis solving global poverty and starvation under a decade instead they choose to be clowns that aim for a higher score
5969,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,you don’t become stinking rich being the average person in the street they are hungry for success but love the power this brings more than the money they love to completely control everything especially over people they are ruthless to the core
5970,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,i never considered them as friends of mine nor blockchain technology

5973,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,always count on cryptocurrency sub to think that a common sense statement like billionaires are never your friend as something so profound like someone just discovered that earth aint flat
5974,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,billionaires are a biproduct of capitalism and ive never liked capitalism

6025,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,dont know much about crypto but once a goon and his posse like sbf get too big for their own britches then its time for people that buy crypto to jump ship and go onto the next coin that isn’t as big
6026,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,musk has done an incredible job in helping human civilization move forward with spacex and tesla i dont want him  or any one for that matter  to own the financial system and thats why i support ethereumdecentralizedfinance but i do support his efforts in those fields which are currently not amenable to decentralization like rocket launches to space and battery electric vehicle manufacturingas for your popcritique of musk which is mostly regurgitated from antimusk tweets by diehard democrats  who are targeting musk only because hes not onboard with the democrats censorship regime  lets parse itelon musk outright manipulates markets to his whim and fancy and seems to find it a fun game that he partakes in gleefully as investors may lose their life savings futures and family fundsmusk exercises his right to free speech by commenting on things if idiots decide to invest based on jokes he tweets about doge thats on them not musk musk has no legal or moral obligation to selfcensor because what he does by tweeting is not manipulate marketshe talks a big game about free speech but has started permanently suspending accounts that impersonate others which are generally actually obvious account parodies especially those done to himwhen those accounts are using the exact same tactic that scammers use to deceive people which is to copy the display name and profile picture of a famous persons account then its no longer just parody its deception and fair game for banninghe also plays a certain segment of crypto investors like fiddles who pump the market and get dumped on when he doesnt follow through on a tweet and heavily suggest ideas he has no intention of implementingsee point one he has a right to free speech casual musings are not indications he intends to do anything and any one who perceives it otherwise only has themselves to blame
6027,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,eat the rich

6031,yq1b7g,2022-11-08 22:55:53,thank you captain obvious anyone he believed otherwise deserves to lose all their money
6306,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i have safely removed my  worth of bitcoin from ftx not taking any chances
6307,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,it’s all smoke he needs to confirm  debt amount of alameda  did alameda borrow from ftx user stable coin deposits using ftt as collateral alameda owns  ftt any creditor with half brain will refuse to accept it as collateral
6308,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ironic gamestop announces partnership with ftx ftx gets bummed
6309,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,lol nobody cares about “supporting” ftx everybody just wants to make money here
6310,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx is now running out of eth  get out now
6311,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,celsius was denying it all also until  days before rekt happened dont risk it people
6312,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,steady lads
6313,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,be on the lookout for coffeezilla investigation video soon lol
6314,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i dont trust cz enough and dont even have anything on ftx however if top exchange gets liquidated there will be more to worry than funds being locked everyone can easily see sub  prices and then cz can keep holding everything and reign supreme
6315,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,all this leak on a sunday is just wild
6316,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,people will never learn they rather defend the platform without questioning it criticallywhy people don’t want to see any negative things related to them thats why they ignore it until it blows up it’s easy and it makes them more comfortable that’s when reality hits them
6317,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,rip ftx in the next  hr
6318,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,nacho keys nacho coins
6319,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sounds eerily similar to what mashinsky was saying before celsius collapsed not making the same mistake again pulled everything off the exchange
6320,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,stablecoin reserver is getting low
6321,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,voyager said everything was fine then boom it’s not
6322,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i thought i heard rumors of ftx wanting to pitch in for private sale of twitter but were denied binance got in on the deal didnt they
6323,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,gamestop announced a partnership with ftx on sept  and gamestop announced gift card promotion with ftx gift cards being sold at gamestop on nov  news of mass exodus and internal issues on nov 🤔
6324,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,another theory ftx stabbed binance in back in some way to get the exclusive rights to some securities or something
6325,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is scary ftx collapsing could potentially collapse the entire crypto market
6326,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,
6327,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,we really need to stop using tweets as a means to provedisprove something
6328,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,can we have  nice quiet green week god we just hit  again and now this shit going on aint nobody got time for that
6329,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,there is no need to gamble guys get your funds to safuty
6330,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i think more people have been losing money listening to your “financial” advice maybe think twice before posting something smart
6331,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,asap  they are scrambling trying to keep withdrawals from pausing  they also increased withdrawal fee to   bank run starting
6332,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ill sue him for helping me make a good decision it broke my  year streak of horrible crypto decisions
6333,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx is the next voyager  people lost millions  you already assume max risk with crypto  don’t lose it all when you see the writing on the wall
6334,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,that took all day but no issues transferring over to kraken better safe then sorry
6335,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,or he saves hundred or thousands of people their money
6336,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,from all exchanges not your keys not your money cheers 
6337,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,unfortunately it seems to be the only place to trade options in the us for normies
6338,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,as much as i want that to be true sounds like cope
6339,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i legitimately cannot believe people still hold funds on centralized exchanges after what happened earlier this year
6340,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,if ftx goes down then the rest of crypto will go down with it 
6341,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx has too much going on still feel like itll hold steady as its been around for a while now sbf been forming partnerships and buying up shit left and right hell sell assets hes accumulated before he let exchange blow up
6342,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx cant collapse lol especially not because of one token they are bigger than ftt way bigger
6343,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,otc deal favors whales at the expense of the normal players i thought the ethos of crypto is primarily about open market  transparency
6344,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,where is this article from this is very well written yep alameda researchftx is a giant predatory entity in the market enough is enough
6345,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i mean if cz decides to nuke the market rather than take the offer he can basically write off ever operating in most of the west this take seems illogical
6346,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,last point is critical imo cryptic tweets from cz probably directed towards sbf’s dc dig are now being contextualized with alameda’s balance sheet problems caroline tweeting at cz further helped him out
6347,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,here comes the liquidations that push btc to the  price levels
6348,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,you shouldnt haveleave your coins on exchanges anyway  we all know this
6349,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,people these days are scared so easily that they make their own worst fears come true im not moving anything off ftx i think they have one of the best platforms available i especially love their less than  minimum oredrs on most coins which allows for excellent bot configurations rcryptobrains
6350,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,well it was nice to see a pump these last days guess we are going back to red these upcoming weeks
6351,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,deploying more capital  steady lads
6352,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,hey look more top level crypto fraud guess who will get porked next retail crypto is weak as f you cant feed your family with digital assets when things start depegging
6353,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,binance wouldnt take that approach if there was nothing to worry about
6354,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is a nothing burger
6355,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sam and caroline tweet like a depressed stripper
6356,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,remember when coinbase was going bankrupt pepperidge farms remembers
6357,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,larry david was right
6358,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx ceo pretty much confirms mass exodus from the platform ok i didnt read that at all what did i miss
6359,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,move your coins if its a false rumor you loose nothing if its true you save your coins
6360,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,remember that celsius ceo was also saying everything was fine before they halted withdrawals id be very careful now if i had funds in ftx
6361,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,
6362,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,plot twist this was all manufactured by cz to eliminate competition  they had the means to start the rumor ftx was a relatively easy mark and pretty exposed to begin with and with all their exit tokens they could put some evidence behind it by selling  i dont have anything on ftx  and if i did i would withdrawal because why not and its that simple and easy for cz to do
6363,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,transferred funds out via ach now just have to cross fingers that it hits the bank account 😬 i tried to transfer crypto out and wouldn’t let me they opened support ticket saying possible fraud and won’t let me transfer any of my crypto had to sell my positions for usd and ach transfer to my account never had issues before
6364,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,lolled at your edits – what has happened to this place commenters deleting their comments because they get downvoted op focusing on upvotesdowvotes in a nonmeta post with fucking  edits its sad but rcc became all about moons all interaction here is faker than tethers audit report ps downvote away idc
6365,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,these rumors are creating a crypto version of a bank run  unfortunately many have already been unbanked by celsius
6366,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,the one thing i learned from voyager and celsius their tweets and public statements dont mean 
6367,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,is this a regular incompetancescammy fuck up that we see in the space or is this some rich asshole trying to dick down another rich asshole
6368,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,battle of the whales going on
6369,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,everything here is accurate except for alluding that cz didnt know sam needed to keep ftt inflated  people give cz all the credit for being the nice guy and never realize he is also a savage businessman
6370,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,is it a good thing that i don’t know what ftx is cheers 
6371,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,its will hurt it but not collapse it however it will tarnish crypto for some time many people already call it a scam etc
6372,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,it’s like an extreme proofofkeys day for ftx a good stress test my guess is they pass it although i’m no fan of sbf
6373,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,nah no one said that about celsius lol celsius was a baby dog in this space ftx is a top  exchange
6374,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,easy when one and affiliate of the competition a tip do you your own opinion on a top  world exchange that thanks to all its work manages to pass in the top  and get closer and closer to binance necessarily its become dangerous 
6375,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is reminding me of do kwons saga massive opportunity to buyback at cheaper prices
6376,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,you wouldnt happen to have the links to the articles would you
6377,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,he is trying to help people not get rekt and you want him to bury his intel and sit on his handsthanks ran for the conviction and courage to make this post
6378,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is just a pr attack from binance ftx is backed by huge players its not going anywhere cz is just trying to take a shot while the market is weak to try and slow its growth
6379,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,liquidating our ftt is just postexit risk management learning from luna we gave support before but we wont pretend to make love after divorce we are not against anyone but we wont support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs onwards  cz of binance 
6380,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,the downvote brigade is out in force tonightits great theyve addressed it but the fear will really sink in for investors when its finalised by binance id be concerned if i were holding ftx right now
6381,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,it reminds me of celsius saying everything is fine and then going insolvent the next day im hoping thats not the case here since the scale is so much bigger with ftx vs celsius but this is crypto and history has shown us that it takes years to build something but only a day to break it down i think well find the truth within a weekso its gonna be a rollercoaster ride this week or just another  days in this crazy land of defi
6382,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,fud
6383,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,how does one profit from this
6384,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftt bagholders and ftx account holders running low on copium
6385,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i had to threaten to sue to pull out  worth in may i look forward to them dying
6386,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx owns parts of pro sports teams and it’s own sports arenas if they go down we’re in big trouble
6387,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i can always count on reddit for my dose of fud
6388,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,meanwhile …cz on the 
6389,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,no it would not if collapse of luna didnt then neither will this
6390,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i do not trust sam one bit
6391,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i really never expected to see anything happen to ftx but it would definitely be huge if something did
6392,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,just pulled my shib gonna miss the  but don’t wanna risk it
6393,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,
6394,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i haven’t removed anything from my ftx account and don’t plan to
6395,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is fud
6396,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,there’s been a constant argument for years wether this guy is a genius or a fucking scam artist it would seem the question is definitely answered
6397,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,voyager and celsius has people scared  for good reason
6398,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,schadenfreud is real but i hope the community  does okay here
6399,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,solana already down  todayas much i dislike sam bankmani hope we dont have another celcius on our handwould absolutely crater the market if ftx goes bust
6400,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,what do you mean denies all rumors or mass exodus  any simple onchain check would show you that theres really nothing different from today or a month ago or even a year ago  rcc has really just become a moons farming simulator and people will do anything to gain upvotes for moons
6401,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,looks like a good time to learn how to short ftt
6402,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,another one bites the dust not your keys not your coins
6403,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,celsius and do kwon have been saying the same thing its not worth the risk
6404,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,if this turns out as fud and ftx is able to weather this mass exodus that would be very telling on how reliable an exchange it actually is might net them a few more users in the long run
6405,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,itt organized anti ftx ops
6406,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,there’s some mafia type gangster politics shit going on here that’s my educated take dog eat dog ruin everyone possible during a bear market the victor claims the spoils
6407,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sounds like the final gasp for air before doing the classic wassawassawassawassawassawassawassawassup move
6408,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,we have seen so many denials prior to shitstorms this doesnt mean anything
6409,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,where there is smoke there is fire
6410,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,lots of people and bots downvote most stuff man how long u been on this sub
6411,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is bank run days all over again history repeats crypto doesnt solve fractional reserve when exchanges like ftx keep their own internal offchain books
6412,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sam is a fraud and ftx is a scam
6413,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,should i dump sol
6414,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,get outif it does turn out to be fud and theyre solvent fine but i still wish id listened when people to us to get out of celsius when i thought it was just gonna blow over
6415,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx and alameda the masters of the pump and dump
6416,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,im sure its fud  but i was able to withdraw my  figures no problem  it did take me about  hours or so tho  im sure its security reasons but im not risking the  to lose all my equityim having cash on side to buy the ftt dip in case if there are liquidationpanic sell going to buy starting from  to all the way to  its a no brainer ppl who trades on ftx know what im talking about  liquidity there is like no other place with no trading fees i actually get paid to trade there due to my volume size
6417,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i think more people especially retail are buying into ftx at the moment that has to be a glitch or just false informationfud campaign i know coinbase  cryptocom are in much worse shape
6418,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sbf is a market manipulator anyways  just sucks it may tank the market as a whole and bring more bad light to the space
6419,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,nothing beautiful than shorting ftt on ftx

6437,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40, they have sufficient assets to cover probate expenses for at least a few days
6438,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,its not about who do i support its about being rather safe than sorry
6439,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx ceo used trustmebro card so they can pack up and run with the money
6440,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ill grab some ftt and sol if this goes crazy low  ftx is hyper regulated and the balance sheet with a ton of ftt in defi was alameda not ftx  people dont really understand business structure in the least if they dont get that two wholly separated legal and corporate entities are two whole separated legal and corporately entities  not to mention the balance sheet said they had nearly double the assets that they had liabilitiesthis is the same industry that has been saying for years that usdt has  backing it despite all evidence saying the opposite  then they said usdc is going insolvent for the lols  they said coinbase is going insolvent because the stock price went down and there are tech issues and then said someone was fucking a horse  nonsense reigns supreme in this space  its an industry full of school girls who latch on to whatever the most insane rumor isthe biggest hate against sbf which translates into hate against everything hes associated with is that crypto regulation is coming and he argues for sensible regulation rather than pissing in the wind and screaming no regulation ever under any circumstances  screaming this despite the fact that its obviously coming tornado cash and ofaccompliant eth block production showing that screaming in the wind isnt stopping or impacting anything anything and duh of course its better to fight for sensible rules rather than be a nonfactor and written off as crazy people screaming at everything and pissing in the wind for no regulations ever under any circumstancesits also weird because people here shit on binance as being this questionable shady player in the space but now the rumor that sbf has said the same thing makes him evil  i say this all the time but we really need to keep that same energy  or just lay off on the fuck shit rhetoric being spewed for lols  the way this sub hops from dicktodick on the drop of a dime is insanemaybe ftx will go belly up but its not going to be because cz is selling their social token and it dumped alameda might have some tough times or lose some money if that happens but thats alameda not ftx
6441,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,the timing of cz doing this is just too suss af after btc closed above a crucial fib on the  bullish momentum… and then does this on a sunday right before a bullish weekly close come on now… clearly binance putting water on the flames just to accumulate more
6442,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,all we need is loopring going to be insane
6443,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,the sad thing is theres still going to be posts from people on this sub crying about how they didn’t see this coming
6444,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i don’t really give a damn about karma i love reddit got most of my bags off ftx just in case previous comment says ftx will fold tomorrow holy shit that’s a prophecy hope it’s not true
6445,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sam doing a mashinsky move… fucking ironic this guy was claiming about insolvent exchanges  🫢
6446,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,isuhnow a good time to buy in
6447,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,audits in usd are so useless they need to be crypto audits how much is on the platform how much is leveraged loaned usd means nothing except for those that have stablesalso who keeps coins on the exchange  banks are just holding on with significant help how are exchanges not going to go underi hope ftx fine we still need competition for binance
6448,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i’d be happy if sbf gets taken out of the cryptosphere
6449,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,dont use em
6450,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,terra luna

6455,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,lehman 
6456,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,as long as they have the funds and arent fractional reserve this shouldnt be an issuewe all see where this is going right
6457,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,funny ive been on the fence about leaving coinbase for ftx im really not a fan of coinbaseeither way i got a strong feeling this is fud guess well find out sooner than later
6458,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx wont go bankrupt pretty easy its an exchange not a lender and its gone
6459,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,it’s a self prophecy everyone panicking about this potentially happening is going to actually causeit to happen if all this talk stopped and everyone didn’t panic withdraw etc they’d be fine
6460,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,if you use ftx earn youre fucked lmao
6461,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,is ftx heading for a shipwreck god i hope retail pulls out before its too late and they wont be able to withdraw
6462,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sbf is no saint shady af
6463,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,thread carefully lads this may be a celsius 
6464,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sfb has always been shady so this turn is not actually surprising
6465,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ahh shit here we go again…
6466,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i am going to be an optimist and say that the death of alameda will remove massive downward pressure on btc via their infinite money fttusd stable fuckeryno shorts see ya  trabuco sbf and the rest of the hive mind npcs colluding against personal wealth for their rational altruism can all get fuckedbtc has been more stable than the stock market for almost a year  ftx was involved in some shit and now they wont be
6467,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,the whole world will be  is in a liquidity crisis and monetary tightening they know this and are fabricating this to get the fuck out of these tokens without seeming like they are blatantly rug pulling everyone they have no choice these crap tokens are going to hell anyway they just need a story to dump it all without seeming like bad guyscrypto is a grand amplifier… through its systems it amplifies excess liquidity it takes x liquidity and seemingly multiplies it many times over by structures that take the liquidity and makes it seem bigger than it really is an illusion how many people do you know that hold ftt amplification works in the other direction too… once the illusion is broken the house of cards starts falling down it only hasn’t happened yet because we were printing money for  freaking years but the jig is up we are about to see the true value of crypto with all the fluff removed
6468,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,…and kucoin keeps rocking the green pun intended in the background as kcs continues to climb back up 😅
6469,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,not too worried about immediate contagion effect if ftx goes bankrupt it will be another mt gox taking years to fully liquidate
6470,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,hows solana doing
6471,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,someone please explain like you would to a  year old what is going on with ftx

6473,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx is who reddit partnered with for eth gas fees for moons
6474,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,is this why the market is dropping
6475,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,

6480,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,im willing to go to trust wallet or something but what about staking
6481,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,this is randomly awful for me as ftx was in the middle of buying up voyager oof
6482,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,what were the rumours looming bankruptcy

6495,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i withdrew a long time ago
6496,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40, switching to a cryptocurrency with low finality and transferring it to your own wallet might be a better course of action
6497,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,not your keys
6498,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,im on so many exchanges i got to keep a spreadsheet to see them
6499,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,whatever they do just keep me and my homies here out of this and dont let investors suffer
6500,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,nacho keys nacho coins
6501,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40, over the last two weeks whatevers going on  thats seriously substantial
6502,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,time to make a ftx account
6503,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,hold your keys people no other wayi dont even trust banks that much with my money  in my country we had a bank go bankrupt and people lost all their money why even consider trusting an exchangeruse them for that they are good for buying then transfer and sleep well
6504,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,be careful
6505,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,knew the guy was a bit fishy wen he was like ima give billions to democrats lol
6506,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40, its similar to witnessing whale fights 
6507,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,and when this blows overfamous last words 
6508,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,remember defi is your friend
6509,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,don’t make the mistake i made south celsius leave when you see the warning signs at minimum don’t hold all your eggs in one basket… stay safe
6510,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,the same sentences were publicly stated in may by terra luna and other cexs  celsius voyager  capital and others sure does smell like desperation seething in
6511,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,people rushing to withdraw now will exasperate things further so even if ftx wasnt going under now it might become a selffulfilling prophecy
6512,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,smells like something we’ve seen here before
6513,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,waiting for coffezilla to cover this topic xd
6514,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,it will give me the best reentry price i could have ever hoped for
6515,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,ftx bought voyagers assets and were going to compensate voyagers creditors this would be bad news for voyager account holders who were hoping to get some of their crypto back i had  of eth on voyager so i get emails about what is being proposed
6516,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,amazing how quickly rumors can spiral out of control ftx is probably fine but i pulled everything just to be safe will probably be back in a month when this blows over
6517,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,what are the odds of this happening after the mlb  which had a partnership with ftx season comes to an end i don’t know how long ftx was to be a partner though
6518,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,after watching matic basically get back to where i bought it but i was too lazy to take out of celcius in maydo the prudent thing and put your coins on cold storage
6519,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i love that because i stake my ada that i never have to worry about these warnings nor a they locked up or slashed you know how staking should work
6520,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,i felt this way during my first bear market it might be his first and it can be pretty bad
6521,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,we dont need exchanges we have dexatmpeer to peercard crypto purchases we should enter crypto and say in and kiss fiat and those pesky banks and fake volume shark brokers and their kyc goodby
6522,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,id me much more likely to take my money out of binance
6523,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,bro i can’t even come up with a response to this joke of an „article“ lol i’ve been trying but where do you even start basically every other line is ridiculous
6524,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,lobbies over  million dollars worth of his companies cash expects people to trust me broso at this point he is essentially a strong arm for the irs to collect tax information better give his company all your information while youre at it uses investors cash to fomo projects with no utility or value instead of buying btc proceeds to lose billions of investors hard earned  on said projects with no utility or value wonders why people wont trust him and then he probably remembers the podcast of him talking about running a ponzi scheme and nobody cares as long as theyre making money even when its the investor who will be holding the bags when theyre dropped final thoughts im pretty sure the idea of crypto is to own your financial freedom not give it away to some soulless corporate entity who only cares about collecting your data and your 
6525,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,sbf is a fraud yep you guessed it a wolf in sheeps clothingfinally being exposed and heard by the cryptosphere
6526,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,what sounds like cope is thinking the market will die with samftx 
6527,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,withdraws are not working everything is stuck in requested state i think its too late already
6528,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,its fairly simple to know if the market is manipulated basically if tether is trading above its fair market value of  the market is fake  not rational  tether  for redeeming directly so assuming you buy  worth of usdt at  the math looks as follows buy  worth of tether at  and receive  usdt redeem on tetherio and pay      receive      on your bank accountthere is no rational basis for buying and selling tether above  but someone is keeping it at 
6529,yo6kxe,2022-11-06 23:40:40,weird how anyone who says they withdrew from the exchange in question is still getting mass downvoted
6860,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,bruh i thought coffeezilla was click baiting when he said sbf admitted to fraud but holy shit he actually did
6861,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,damn coffee is relentless he’s hunting down sbf better than some governments 😂
6862,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,you know what my favorite part of this entire video is right at  when he gets off the call and doesnt have to keep a straight face and straight voice the entire time while sbf admitted to screwing up i went how is he holding it together and then the call ends and he just starts laughing and smiling amazing work by coffee here i cant believe we need to rely on twitter spaces while nyt and others write puff pieces portraying him as a victim these poor heckin rich people make mistakes too guys all i can do is hope that sbf rots in prison for this this wasnt an accident unfortunate to see and meanwhile gary gensler is quiet as a mouse
6863,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffe so you didnt have separation of buckets you cant pass the blame to alameda here its your company that did that the depositors were mingled with the most risky assets you hadsbf hey you are monopolizing this conversation now you have to let other peoples talklol
6864,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,this guy is going to put sbf in jail lmao
6865,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i used forbidden customer funds because it was the only way to allow withdrawals during the collapse if you think i shouldve rushed to code a withdrawal system that actually adhered to ftx terms to protect customer funds then i disagree with you youre just grandstandingthis thieving little bitch really admitted this just now
6866,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffee brought the heat 🥵🔥🔥🔥
6867,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf is used to people he’s smarter than asking him questions coffey actually asked him difficult questions and didn’t give him ways to weasel out of which is why sam got defensive and said he was monopolizing the conversation sam was looking for a quick exit because any more time talking to coffey coffey woulda exposed more of his bullshit and sam knew that
6868,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffee makes a great point at the end perhaps there is some clear proof of this fraud in that code for withdrawals if he is saying they would have had to frantically change the code it had to have been bogus from the start
6869,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,he got pinned down on bullshitting and finally started lashing out hahahaha let others talk cause youre grandstanding i didnt treat funds on different terms as equal i treated the withdrawals equal but i didnt make that decisionhahahahahahaha
6870,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i fucking love coffee by a far the best crypto journalistinvestigator out there
6871,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf’s voice is just how i expected it to be
6872,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffeezilla is a national treasure
6873,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffee this is the whole problem of the story of ftx and alameda is all the funds were being comingled isnt this just another story of comingling funds except this is now ftx which means you cant pass the blame to alameda anymore this is your company your funds that you are treating all the clients the same when they have clearly signed to different terms of service                     sbf got absolutely smoked by coffeezilla and had basically nothing to answer with
6874,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,every agency investigating ftx should watch this video
6875,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,‘finally… the smoking gun  lock this man up
6876,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19, is fucking gold jesus christ this little fucking weasel lol
6877,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,why cant we have more coffeezillas and less sbfs in this world
6878,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,if sbfs tactic was to come out all dumb and innocent then it’s backfired massively
6879,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,holy crap this is not coffeezilla making up shit this is sbf admitting he had no fucking process you entered risk the same way the gambler did and this is fucked up when they give you then  page tos you agree to now fbi and usg do your job this was fraud of a us licensed company
6880,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i still cant believe how dumb this guy is when you commit crimes the first thing you do is not talk the second thing you do is get as far away from people as possible why sam did not flee to a non extradition country with a good deal of money is beyond me these interviews he keeps doing thinking hes going to talk his way out of it they are going to play these at his trial you know what the jury is going to do the same thing everyone reading this is going to do the guy deserves to go to prison on stupidity alone at this point 🤣
6881,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf when finding out it’s coffeezilla on the other 
6882,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,it wasnt a hard line of questioning to ask its just that the other interviewers were clueless about anything props to coffeezilla for getting the screentime with sbf i knew he would eventually get it right
6883,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffeezilla did it again 🐐
6884,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,frost v nixon
6885,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffee has been exposing scammers for years glad to see his channel is blowing up
6886,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,it’ll be fun to watch an entire generation slowly realize how the world really works
6887,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf made a critical mistake he thought he could just buy out msm in order to protect himself but coffeezilla is not msm he is a youtuber who gets rewarded with more subscribers when he does actual journalism unlike the puppets at nyt
6888,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,
6889,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,next question does your wife cheat on your husband as much as you cheat at cryptofinal question what is your mothers phone number
6890,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,lmao him lashing out when he got cornered was pretty funny
6891,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,dude  his lawyers have got to be just shaking their heads at this point
6892,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,argh man he sounds just like my  yearold trying to explain how she hasnt just drawn all over our bathroom walls when shes standing right next to said walls with the felt tips in her hands
6893,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,hello police i’d like to report an extreme fraud exposure
6894,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,im curious to see what his dad is going to say to him after watching this interview daddy already took the next semester off to help him
6895,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,every video coffeezilla makes of sbf being on his media roadshow makes me wonder if sbf has a lawyer at all how can you let your client go on air so many times knowing he’ll probably slip up at some point then again somehow magically all billionaires avoid jail time i just wonder what the timer on the buff is if you stop being a billionaire
6896,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,imagine being sbf
6897,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i like when he gets asked a serious question and starts uh um uhhhhhhhhhh

6899,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,hard to keep a lie straight when you’re so deep into it the amount of “um” he used is super telling
6900,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i just finished watching this absolutely amazing job from coffeezillahe has him on tape saying it but still i doubt anything will be done lock this man up
6901,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf is done
6902,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i just  we processed withdrawals as we normally doso the funds certainly were comingled the entire time according to sbf he knew that  he even stops himself and says we instead of i to try and spread out the culpability on this decision that was madepeople were promised  safe backing for their banked digital assets but instead were exposed to the level of risk of options traders degenerate trading on marginsbf knew that while promising safety to people not trading options or marginthe safety was a lie the entire time those traders promised safe banking were getting none of the safety and all of the risk
6903,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,why didnt he asking about pinning the weasel though 
6904,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,only recently started watching coffeezilla when the ftx implosion was starting and have to say he has completely won me over this series on sbfftx is the investigative journalism that we wish we had anytime we click on a news article or watch the news
6905,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,cool do caroline next they are both just as dirty and guilty imo

6909,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,listened to the entire interview  impressive how dedicated coffeeszilla was to researching all the other interviewers  wherehowwhy they all failed to corner sbf  coffeezilla figured out where the best corner was to push sbf into how to boxhimin so that that he couldnt evaporate out of with scummy marketing language and how to squeeze him once he got him pinned on the ropes  coffeezilla nailed it
6910,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,you need to let others speak you need to respond to what im saying and not grandstandclassic narcissist move when cornered i know every loves the n word these days butdarvodenyattackreverse victim and offenderif not narcissism classic psychological manipulation he is out of reasonable responses or even pretend reasonable responses gaslighting smoke and mirrorsso far sam has focused on the deny or a least the blame alemeda in which he avoids answering the real questioncoffee finally pinned sam down there is no logical way to deny so he becomes illogical in his response because he cant directly admit it yetyou need to respond to what im saying meansim trying not to respond to what youre saying
6911,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,doing gods work

6913,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,how tf does an independent youtube journalist is better at asking questions than msm because his the real deal not some left wing democrat propaganda machine
6914,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffee hitting sbf hard with good dawn reasonlook terms of service said you committed fraud  loli wanna know how the tokenized stocks that where supposed to be backed  where never purchased  and where any of those tokenized stocks used to illegally naked short popular tickers
6915,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,can sbf go to jail for saying this hoping he does
6916,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,yeah this dude is fuckin done coffee nailed his ass to the floor this time
6917,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,how is he not arrested yet
6918,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,congrats u got him to admit to what literally everyoneanyone with a brain already knowsknew but guess what none of that matters becuz hes still got hundreds of millions and is doing interviews and the talk circuit cuz he bribed the right ppl  this scumbag is the new golden goose for the greedy but go ahead and pat yourselves on the back for sticking it to the man xd tbc i dont dislike coffeez  but watching socialmedia act like they have scored a victory here when all that has happened is that hundreds of millions of ppl got scammed for billions and literally the ppl who did the scamming are free af  its just delusional to act like the littleguy got anything but royally fucked here
6919,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,amazing how he can go  us fully solvent and could do withdrawals tomorrowtowe put everyones money into  bucket and never separated it like our terms said we would and there is nothing  like a ponzi scheme and fraud using other peoples funds for someone elses withdrawal
6920,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,lock this guy up now
6921,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i love coffeezilla
6922,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,wow sbf just keeps sinking to new lows
6923,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbfs bubble is about to pop
6924,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf out there giving interviews like a rockstar doesnt even look like he scammed billions
6925,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,ooof its almost never a good idea to complain about the interviewer youll always come off like you have something to hide
6926,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,legend not sbf
6927,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,i had a bad month
6928,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,so are there enough assets in ftx to technically make those that didnt sign up to margin lendingtrading whole again would this even matter in a bankruptcy scenario are they considered a high creditor because of itseems clear that there was some fundamental issues with the way ftx treated inflow and outflow of assets and cashfrom what he said it sounds like ftx allowed mass withdrawals to avoid the snowball affect of hysteria which would only delay the inevitable by a few days
6929,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,fantastic
6930,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,he barely snapped at coffee compared to some other fraudsters although a salty sbf is very rare
6931,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,when the show about sbf eventually gets made i want to see a reenactment of coffeezilla relentlessly springing surprise interviews on sbf and getting him to admit to fraud
6932,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19, what
6933,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,well done
6934,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,send him to prison
6935,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,sbf do you want me to stop everybody from withdrawing to fix the high severity bug that i knew has been there since the beginningto protect your customers fund the correct answer is yes dont know why even coffee thought obviously no was the appropriate answer there might be panic but its better than making it first come first serve and allow those with insider knowledge to be made whole
6936,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffeezilla on fire
6937,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,coffee going in for the kill

6948,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,hearing sbf admit to fraud is actually chilling this man seriously doesn’t see the problem with his actions
6949,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,a truly gotcha bitch moment 
6950,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,great job coffeezilla to navigate around all the so well i think followed by bs to get an actual confession of fraudsomehow however i fear it will have no impact sbf is politically protectedonly dark net services can bring justice in his case
6951,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,we need scam bankrupt fraud behind bars

6977,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,one more charge to add on to the pile of things hell never be held accountable for wooo
6978,zfg33f,2022-12-07 22:23:19,another sad news for crypto
7224,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,flight to safety lol id trust a broken condom more than robinhood
7225,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,it could be people transferring it in to sell it and cash out not necessarily storing it there
7226,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,crypto is confusing and managing your own wallet is scary and does carry some risk  people are already used to exchanges for things like stocks so an exchange like robinhood seem like a logical choice to them  however they dont realize that most of the risk mitigation and government protection and oversight on stock exchanges doesnt apply to crypto exchanges  this is a perfect example of why the whole managing wallets needs to be made easier and that the risk of not your keys not your coins needs to be better explained
7227,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robinhood is a publicly traded company which is audited by a legit firm not based in the metaverse ftx is headquartered in the bahamas and has no obligation to undergo such audits no matter what you think of vlad one is the safer choice
7228,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,maybe hes lying wouldnt be the first ceo to do so
7229,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,compared to any of these crypto exchanges robinhood is safe lol at least theyre publicly traded and actually have to report their financials lol
7230,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i mean robinhood did such a great job stopping the trading of game stop to protect the big guys when it really counted surely they wouldnt do that with crypto am i right people and their stupidity amazing me yet again
7231,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,jesus christ are you serious these people must be upset they didnt lose their money on ftx so they are hoping robinhood takes it lol
7232,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,well robinhood is still in a highly regulated business at least compare to the crypto space so they are probably more safe than pure crypto exchanges
7233,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,sick moon farm robinhood is a public company your crypto atleast won’t be leveraged to the tits
7234,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,well just like coinbase people are going to feel safer on a us based regulated business then ones they have no idea whats going on
7235,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,f robinhood
7236,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,the crypto market is the circus and we are the clowns
7237,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,well can’t save people who don’t want to be saved when rh screws them we will see the thread after thread of people saying help well had you spent  minutes to educate yourself on what crypto is and how to store it you’d be in a different situation right now
7238,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,you reach a certain age where you just slap yourself on the head for forgetting rule number  people are stupid
7239,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,no wonder he is still in business after pulling all those dirty tricks
7240,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,unfortunately  of the people in crypto dont understand or agree with the crypto ethos which is among others economic sovereigntyexchanges can be used momentarily to purchase crypto but if you dont hold your own keys youre not really using crypto
7241,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people buy coins over bsc  dont expect much
7242,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,managing your own wallet is meaningless unless you have a means to convert that wallet to actual fiat to spend on something at some point people are moving to robinhood because they can sell for usd and take that money out if they need to crypto isn’t worth shit if it can’t eventually be redeemed
7243,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,its not crypto the problem its the people in this space
7244,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i think robinhood is a public company with sec oversight there is some safety there same for coinbase
7245,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i have a bag on rh and i won’t apologize for it it allows me to swap between stocks and crypto as i feel appropriate usually bad timing but that’s on me haha sure they messed up during the height of the gme drama but otherwise they seem to provide a solid service plus i like that their brokerage is regulated and publicly traded meaning it has some expectation of operating on the up and up
7246,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,haha hopefully robinhood has become a better platform it is easier to use and has a lot of helpful features works better on mobile than coinbase we just need those fees down and for the platform to be stable enough to the point where they do not halt trades at their convenience too me it sounds like they want the majority to lose when too many win you cant sell that is a huge flaw in the industry
7247,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i agree with this in principle but you’re wrong for singling out robinhood while they’re not above criticism they’re a legit company that’s embracing the crypto mindset specifically self custody of course not your keys not your crypto but wait til they launch a custodial wallet similar to the coinbase wallet unless you have some insider info that i dont know this post is  fud
7248,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,oh you didnt know people are stupid
7249,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,imagine being a rich person sending your money to an exchange called robinhood
7250,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,vlad is this flight to safety everyone no vlad its not
7251,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,you mean the robinhood in which sbf has a stake in these people never learn
7252,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,to be honest right now robin hood look like saints
7253,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,not only that out of all the places they chose robinhood this will definitely lead to new drama when theres any big movement on the market and they block people from doing trades this is what i fear people forget and in a year from now ftx may well be on its way to acquiring new costumers and growing again
7254,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,the boys behind all these derivative scams are the same theyre just playing hot potato with their collateral
7255,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,out of the frying pan and into the fire
7256,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,they are selling
7257,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,this could just be a case of experts say something so you do what we want type of things just because he tweets it doesnt mean its real maybe hes trying to convince people to do what he suggest others are doing  even when no one is actually doing that
7258,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people will choose convenience over safety  of the time people will choose convenience over everything  of the time
7259,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,unless they are posting wallets or transactions im not really listening to all these guysthey will lie all the way to the endas a wise man once said use them like a public toilet you go in you do your business and you get outthey are exchanges not banks do not forget this
7260,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,im sure hes being completely truthful and there are no other motives behind this post
7261,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,at this point robinhood weathered their storm compared to ftx yeah some people would view them as safe
7262,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,please can you tell me a fiat onramp that is not a cex
7263,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,if you are buying crypto for the revolution you are possibly the dumbest motherfucker alive
7264,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,by owning you mean holding in private walletsbut what wallets i cant even trust metamask trust n others that are around
7265,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,cause people don’t know the use of it and it’s considered an investment robinhood allows normal people to trade in and out of crypto and stocks on one platform they may be trash but they created a luring platform
7266,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,a few weeks ago  of you would have said transfer from rh to ftx
7267,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,rh couldnt even be honest when it came to trading actual equities but people trust these thieves with crypto rofl
7268,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,most people are just stupid instead of doing research they sign up for the first exchange they see
7269,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i wouldnt even trust robinhood with my ex bitchy girlfriend let alone my crypto and money
7270,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,lets make those cexes obsolete
7271,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,why wouldn’t you buy now if you bought at the top and believe in crypto
7272,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,some people never learn 
7273,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,did people learn nothing fuck robinhood
7274,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i dont use robinhood but in comparison to what ftx was doing they seem like choir boys lol
7275,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people who still use robinhood after everything that’s happened over the past few years… smh
7276,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i have zero interest in owning a wallet and i will  continue to work with cryptoexchanges
7277,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,this robinhood hate is wild it all stems from the gme fiasco buy button disabling but almost every other app also did this robinhood is fine honestly maybe not for crypto but still
7278,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,hopefully this is just clearing a really low bar can’t imagine using rh for anything
7279,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,fuck robinhood
7280,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people are just confused and panicked and in the end they make a mistake like depositing on robinhood 😄
7281,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,fight to safetyhahahahahahahahahahahahaha
7282,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,runs from sketchy crypto exchangeruns right to robinhoodbad decision music intensifies
7283,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,what is wrong with peoplewhat if it is just you believing in all that bullshit he is telling
7284,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,…or he could be lying

7286,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i wonder how they rh are still afloat
7287,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robing hood at its finest
7288,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i guess you mean cexs
7289,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,he seems like a good guy does he do the effective altruism thing too please take my money
7290,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,its obvious that people are so scared right now that they are going off their exchanges to enter the few very big exchanges that they think are too big to fail like binance coinbase and now robinhoodbut they will suprised to see that nothing is too big to fail
7291,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,fools will find ways to lose their money
7292,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,a fool and his money
7293,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,why would anyone believe him rh is failing hard and the dude will say anything to regain their lost popularity    scammers gonna scam yo
7294,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,time to dump my whole portfolio into rh hopefully no one “hacks” them and i don’t lose all my coins
7295,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robinhood is now a safe haven and people are glad to pour life savings into its protective net
7296,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,maybe sell it for gme they have infinite amount of that so you won’t be blamed for crashing anything
7297,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,aint robin hood the ones who screwed the apes on gme shorts and let the whales swim off with their cashsome people never learn
7298,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,if you can’t handle a metamask account and figuring out the web of defi earnings yourself or worry about the security of a seed phrase there’s an answer on open beta rgiddydefi is a simple easy to use wallet app that allows mfa password recovery and oneswipe defi investing totally noncustodial if you want simple and easy selfcustody that’s the answer for you
7299,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people are dum
7300,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,what does cz have to do with what ftx didserious question because the sub seems very divided on whos worse
7301,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,its not that im losing faith in crypto im losing faith in humanity with these news
7302,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,anyone keeping large amounts of crypto on a cex long term is asking to lose their crypto at this point  too many examples over the last year  make your trade and get whatever you have on it offbut but the staking rewards bro   at this point  ownership and in my own wallet is more important for me
7303,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,buy the dip
7304,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,they did a “buy some crypto hold for  days get ” promo a few weeks back and that got a bunch of new people to buy crypto
7305,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i feel like the particular echo chamber of the internet were in now is way less likely to do something this stupid than the average person who doesnt use this subso yeah youre preaching to the choir
7306,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,ugh  i hope hes just lying but if what hes saying is true thats depressing
7307,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people like water will look for the earliest way to do things even if it has negative implications in the future
7308,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,maybe people are transferring their crypto back to robinhood to cash out a smart move like they would have been smart to store it off of the exchange
7309,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,rip peoples wallets
7310,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,please no f robinhood
7311,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robinhood guaranteed bankruptcy by end of  or ill eat an entire pizza not a joke
7312,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,you can’t believe this
7313,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,yeah because theyve never had actual crypto before 😂
7314,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,‘becoming billionaires’ maybe you could have said that two years ago
7315,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,everyone is here for money  i used to believe there were other reasons but it is  money and i’m always proven right
7316,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,bluewallet  free  mobile phone based  dont trust cex certainly not robinhood  ftx even had a  owning robinhood 
7317,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,drs your crypto
7318,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,let me say something awful but certain people really deserve to lose their money there are news and posts everywhere about what is happening with exchanges but they do the opposite
7319,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,how would you make cexs obsolete without having a fiat offramp
7320,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,cz has done for crypto more than you will do in your entire life
7321,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,what hot wallet should i use for btci dont have a cold wallet but i have devices that are new and not being used so i intend to use them solely as walletsi know you cant hold btc on mmi thought about wbtc but i feel it might be safer to hold btc on the bitcoin networkany advice
7322,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,the same robinhood that had a liquidity crisis and had to do an emergency fund raising in the middle of the night to stay solvent
7323,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,mind you this is the same app that tells people they are buying crypto with no on chaindata ie an iou i know few things in life but  rule is don’t trust anyone named vlad lmao
7324,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,holy shit i shot my self in footbetter shoot my self in leg to make it better
7325,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people want protection decentralized exchanges and self custody is inherently prone to loss if you have a solution to that problem you should share because no one else does either except centralized custody providers the inherent flaws in crypto are why “newbies get rekt” and people turn against crypto it’s not easy to use it’s not safe it’s risky to send or receive it’s unclear who to trust to acquire it or offload it and it has a long ways to go those are known facts yet you use broad strokes to paint all cex as bad assuming you have a retirement account you don’t request the stock certificates and hold them yourself do you
7326,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,lol people will never learn probably the worst app of all to move crypto over to
7327,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,cexes are our fiat onramps as onramps  is not a reliable solution especially for adoption of the masseshow do you buy crypto with fiat in a dex
7328,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,who the fuck still trusts a word that they write or speak lol
7329,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i think the answer is pretty easy to understand most people would rather follow than lead taking self custody and understanding how all that works requires some effortan analogy could be gaming the majority of people would rather follow a youtube video on how to do something rather than figure it out themselves if they are playing a game this translates into the rest of their life just the same
7330,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i think robinhood was a lot of peoples introduction to crypto and investing for some people its just where they feel comfortable because its where they have always been
7331,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i wouldn’t trust an exchange with my money ever least of all robinhood after all those gme shenanigans
7332,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,y’all need exchanges to pump the price since crypto is at this point purely a speculative trading instrument if everyone holds in wallets and transacts privately with no newbies and day traders then crypto is tapped
7333,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,they will learn the hard way as did i they will try to sell for some  profits at peak values only to have the sell button deactivated bent over a chair i hate this company with all my heart and i take physical joy whenever i see their stock decline its an antidepressant for me
7334,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i dont think its that weird ftx was one of the biggest exchanges and ideal for daytraders their platform is gone now people are just looking for alternatives im sure every exchange has seen a massive spike in clientellei get the whole selfcustody thing but theres alot of people that like to trade constantly having to deposit and withdraw your trading funds is a pain in the ass if you have to do it every single day not to mention the fees that some of these exchanges ask for it aswell was even more rampant when eths gas prices were peaking youd pay  usd to withdraw to cold every single day now imagine having a limited trading wallet of  or  youd be stupid to blow  every single day to narnia next to people that like to hodl you have people that like to trade now if ur hodling on a exchange youre doingvit wrong but ftx was a real traders exchange so people trying find a new home isnt that weird
7335,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,
7336,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,take my award you really deserve it for this post i hope more and more people will see it this way
7337,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,the beatings will continue until morale improves
7338,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,vlad is probably full of shit and just promoting transferring crypto to rh for anyone dumb enough to listen to anything out of his mouth…
7339,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,its probably not true but marketing
7340,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i am so proud right nowi advised my followers that this was the most correct course of action in these troubling timesfollow me for more incredible crypto tips
7341,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i give up
7342,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,also maybe hes lying
7343,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,no shit it ls because paper hands are selling
7344,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people forget so soon wait until they cant withdraw their doge haha
7345,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,they have only had wallets less than a year so this makes sense like it or not robinhood is probably one of the safer exchanges id still get a ledger
7346,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,prob bullshit tbh
7347,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people dont actually want to be their own bank
7348,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,probably just to sell the assets as much as i hate rh i’ve always received my funds into my bank account when i wanted it can’t say that i trust the crypto exchanges to do that right now if you do sell your crypto at least your fiat is fdic insured that’s my understanding anyway
7349,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i trust a blind man to guide me in life rather than trusting vlad 
7350,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,your average person is dumb as fuck he is going to keep buying doggy coins and keep losing it on cexs and other scams and hes not gonna learn anything
7351,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,trying to get there piece of the pie but using a knife to eat
7352,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,it’s called people are dumb plus i guess it may be actually safer then other exchanges since robinhood has lots of other assets then just crypto…
7353,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,spoiler alert hes lying
7354,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,so how many robin hood shares diddoes ftx own sbf owns over  of robin hoods share capital and was trying to dump it at a  discount to market which was declined by the prospective purchaser because of potential legal issues if i was moving my crypto to another exchange i’d be very cautious about robin hood it wouldn’t be my first second or third choice that’s for sure
7355,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i’m just here so i don’t get fined
7356,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,he is just saying this to pump the stock since sbf was such a big shareholder this screams of corruption and pumping and dumping
7357,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people really are dumb this is gonna be something special to watch maybe this time he gets thrown in prison once they go insolvent that fuking scum
7358,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people are so institutionalized that they think they need someone else to hold their crypto we should inky have exchanges for on and off ramps once we demand stores take bitcoin and stable coins there will be a smaller need for these cexs
7359,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,shits flow toward shitholes
7360,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,lol    day traders dont want to hold their crypto in cold storage they need to hold it on an exchange to make quick trades   this sub is a drop in the bucket of world wide crypto users the only people seeing this message are people who already know they should use self custody
7361,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,unfortunately there is a large core of people that have identified their investing likeness with robinhood really hard to change the ramifications of that
7362,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,next politicians money laundering scheme is launching
7363,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,what an arrogant thief
7364,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,you know it’s bad when ppl are running to vlad for safety
7365,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,lol robbinghood has proven to be a cfd trading criminal company committing securities fraud being the puppet of various hedge funds burn robbinghood
7366,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,with all the uncertainty i think a toaster in a tub of water id safer than robinhood
7367,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,a fool and their money is easily parted
7368,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,hello fellow ape
7369,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,if they lose all no sorry for them
7370,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,they never learn lose money in one place lose money in another and masses will blame crypto as a whole after that
7371,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,ftx trying to exit scam lol
7372,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,yeah i don’t buy it one but guys probably lying especially since sbf owns  of hood they probably know their stock is about to tank so they want to make themselves seem better than they are
7373,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,mass adoption in relatively stable economies will probably be people not knowing about carrying about or adhering to crypto ideals about selfcustodythis will be less so in war torn countries and places where asset seizure are the historical norm
7374,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,dumb people who are smart enough to transfer crypto i dont get it
7375,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,if youre going to have crypto on a cex and it isnt kraken you are rolling the dice  im not trying to shill but do your own research and youll come to the same conclusion
7376,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,id trust a dirty toilet more than robin hood
7377,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,its like nobody remembers what happened a little over two years or so ago with robinhood
7378,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,if robinhood recently opened wallets just  inflow would be enough to call it biggest inflow
7379,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i trust robinhood more than i trust kucoini trust just about everyone more than i trust robinhood though
7380,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,just let people do what they want
7381,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,the biggest inflow ever relative to their own history doesnt really mean anything
7382,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,agree 
7383,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,gee idk op do i put my crypto money in some shady cex that has zero oversight and might be using a fractional reserve system or do i choose a publicly traded company with shit tons of oversight and laws to protect me pretty easy choice in the current crypto environment
7384,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,hahaha in the mist of ftx voyager  celsius ect you sheep still go this bullshit what a confusing bunch of internet people
7385,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people are a mixture of afraid and inexperienced they want in on crypto without understanding what it’s about they just want to make some money selling crypto as an investment strategy rather than a revolutionary and fundamental shift in economics was bound to happen it will suffer from the same thing that out traditional financial institution suffers from we just have to informeducate and hope enough people try to learn more about crypto
7386,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,flight from one cex to an even worse cex shaking my head people so many uneducated people in the space or just plain old ignorance who are going to make the same mistake time and time again
7387,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,context  robinhood started on crypto when confidence with them was at an all time low now that all of these crypto failures are happening there would be more people moving funds everywhere they can you should be happy the increased inflow is only happening now which means these are the guys that arent really in the cutting edge of the tech they wouldnt even be in crypto without robinhood or fidelity
7388,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,they dont know about selfcustody
7389,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robinhood is a very easy onoff ramp for many doesn’t mean people are storing it there
7390,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,some of you suggest that rh is just the offramp i wonder if theres also some of that houbicryptocom loaning of assets before rh proves reserves  kind of bullshit going on as well
7391,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,one of the key purposes of the exchanges is to provide liquidity
7392,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,there is nothing tech about crypto and increasingly nothing money
7393,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22, i think ppl just want in inclusion is a helluva drug fomo to the max
7394,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,simple people are too lazy to handle their own keys average person will always choose path of least resistance
7395,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,because crypto is confusing af to the average person the chance to lose money or get hacked is extremely high as is the entry requirements if youre not an above average skill computer user but the average person still wants to be in so they use something that makes it easy
7396,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,it’s called “any port in a storm”
7397,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,big inflows yea because people are selling
7398,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,flight to safety xdwhat a fucking joke but ofc vlad said that hes another parasite looking to grift this new influx of plebs
7399,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i do not care what crypto he or she believes will succeed but this i agree with wholeheartedly 🫂
7400,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,nothing people want the cheapest fee and they have that
7401,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,people may not know robinhood only allows you to transfer out up to  usd a day of crypto so you could get your crypto stuck there if you got a lot
7402,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,who tf owns crypto on rh yall straight up silly stocks are barely real there crypto is fake af af
7403,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,fool us once ok fool us twice …ok fool us three times … …also ok
7404,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,yah most people are not plugged into what services are good and bad
7405,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,out of all the exchanges robinhood feels the safest
7406,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,of all the places hood
7407,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,but robinhood only does about  of volume through crypto so they arent totally an exchange also theyve been around since  not like these other clowns i keep a tiny bit on robinhood but i transfer out like once a month or so they also carry crime insurance to cover some damages if they get hacked or whatnot that said dont ever leave anything on an exchange youre not  comfortable losing
7408,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,no one ever learns and those who has this happen to them shouldn’t be crying this is clearly they own ignorance
7409,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,vlad is glad people really have the memory of a goldfishrobinhood this guy is worse than ftx he has been doing shady stuff in regulated markets  let alone crypto
7410,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i call bullshit
7411,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,what can you do with most of the cryptos out there outside of buying and selling  cash still king
7412,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,false advertising i reckon
7413,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robinhood is just too easy the ui is so simple and people want that
7414,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,biggest inflow in goblintown yeah must be true
7415,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,why because no one cares about some bullshit coin some moron came up and copied the white paper its  just trading to get profits from a bigger fool if you cant swap to dollars or euros why bother thats why people keep their shit coins on exchanges with fiat onoff rampsthen theres the  who hold btc and eth for long term even most of them prefer to have the ramp ready if shit hits the fan just like now stable coins are not an option for anyone with half a brain celli dont see why anyone would ask why this is happening its happening because the entire crypto market is a huge pile of stinking waste and the fact that some of it is not doesnt really change the landscapealso most people are dumb as bricks and have no clue that there are alternatives they do know robinhood though
7416,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i think a reasonable answer is people like me who have money invested i have legit like  don’t know what the hell they’re doing it’s called having a smooth brain after seeing the ftx news i’m understanding key things like having crypto on a service like the upheld standards of robinhood doesn’t make any sense i’m trying to learn how one stores their own cryptocurrency… any helpdirection would be cool
7417,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,remember appear strong when you are weak  its just a tweet from twaat
7418,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,when ceos start to randomly declare everything is fine
7419,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,no because robinhood has some shady history thats why do you trust everyone blindly who are involved in financial world jesus melvin is fine archeagos is fine financial world is fine its not

7425,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,didn’t robinhood already have the issue back when the whole gme  amc situation went and they had issues with liquidity so people after already seeing and suffering a liquidity crisis run to the next farm over that had previously caught on fire to take shelter 😂 this some wallstreetbets level stuff

7427,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22, what is wrong with peopleline goes up is an infamous video about nfts cryptocurrency etc imo the most interesting part was the mentality of crypto believers the crypto space uses cultlike techniques and some people fall for themstaying away from robin hood is an admission that exchanges cant be trusted most crypto believers dont seem to believe in not your keys not your coins because thats admitting a problem with cryptocurrency so of course its totally fine to trust robin hood

7436,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robinhood halted buying when they didnt have access to more shares of gme to pass on clients due to lack of  managed to have a negative btc balance meaning they showed total costumer btc balance to be a number bigger than the btc they had in  got shit on for doing it correctly ftx just lied and is facing bankrupcy because of it
7437,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,ftx invested in robinhood
7438,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,id suggest anyone trusting rh with their hard earned money to take a good hard look at january  off the buy button should have everyone raising the alarm that these guys like ftx dont have the collateral to back up what they sell and say they own
7439,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,robin hood has been a joke for ages nowit’s like getting your younger brother to look after your weed stash
7440,yu2bdn,2022-11-13 13:54:22,i use robinhood to hold a good portion of my funds and the rest are in cold storagehonestly i trust them more than i do most exchanges even after the whole gme debacle
7702,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,how can americas supposed top journalists like sorkin and stephanopolis not even ask any followup questions when sbf contradicts himself the only thing i can think is they do not truly understand it themselves and dont want to reveal their ignorance sam cannot handle any pushback on his mumbling and it shows  coffeezilla just skewered main stream journalism in less than  minutes
7703,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,if sbf isn’t in jail within  months i’m moving to the bahamas and opening a crypto exchange
7704,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,damn this guy sbf can not tell  sentence without mumbling

7708,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,great to see coffeezilla still keeping it real and independentsome are calling for him to team up with other major media publications but we need him to stay independent so that he can report on whatever he wants to without being influenced by a boardlet sbf keep digging
7709,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,he was probably playing league of legends actually that will probably be his alibi
7710,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,i um what um basically what um happened is i um don’t specifically um know
7711,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,coffezilla is the only crypto youtuber one can trust
7712,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,listening to sbm talk is unbearable takes him  seconds to complete  sentence ‘um um so…basically um there were um the display on ftx was um so like um basically i dont um really know’
7713,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,coffeezilla is great love his content

7717,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,damn coffee destroyed him  im surprised sfb accepted the interview hope we got more people like coffee and less bitchboy in youtube
7718,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,best part of the interview around  who controlled this secret stub accountuhhh idid anyone at alameda know about this secret stub account i mean are we supposed to believe that there was this stub account that nobody knew aboutuhhh i dont know who knew about what one im sorryi mean clearly somebody lost the money i mean obviously the money went somewhere somebody lost it i just seems really convenient that  billion dollars was located in this account that didnt show up when you pull up alamedas balances rightyeah i uh dont know what to tell you
7719,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,glad someone’s not tossing sbf softballs like the msm apparently has been doing

7723,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,i’ve never heard his voice before and it makes me want to strangle him now imagine him and his gremlin girlfriend making sex noises good god
7724,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,i would have loved if the interview ended with a punch to sbf’s face
7725,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,the chad “asking the hard questions” coffeezilla vs the virgin “tweeting outside his house” bitboy
7726,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,i’m telling you from experience he’s a privileged kid on stimulants who lives in a bubble and even now continues to he needs to stand trial but if he did that now while still pumped full of that shit he’d continue to manipulate his thoughts himself and those who love and support him
7727,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,sbf makes noises like those youd expect of a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar being asked if hes stealing cookies from the cookie jar before cautiously answering nno
7728,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,corey feldman should definitely play him in the movie
7729,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,you know sbf is a liar and a fraud when he has to stutter every other word answering pretty straight forward questions
7730,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,after watching that interview i feel bad for sbf  he made many embarrassing mistakes and he said hes sorry   so i will forgive him its ok since it was only a few billion  s
7731,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,honestly the best person to question sbf everyone else in the call didnt have a clue how to pin him down
7732,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,i accidentally slaped sbf and he love it
7733,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,what a face
7734,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,sbf a real traitor
7735,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,til you can create ledger accounts with fake money and somehow make that money real one neat trick
7736,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,coffeezilla did some great work right here but at the same time i could not make it through it all listening to sbf mumble his way through his answers just makes me frustrated
7737,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,dude sounds like he hasnt hit puberty yet 😕 😐
7738,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,ive seen worms on a fishing hook squirm less than sbf coffezilla is one of the best at exposing shady operations in the crypto crypto space
7739,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,the closes thing to justice were getting about ftx  sbf is coffee ambushing him in interviews hes trying to do with other people who cant make him as uncomfortable
7740,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,coffee always roasting his expose on safemoon was 🔥🔥🔥
7741,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,video will not load   alt url
7742,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,sbf has been on this total exoneration tour for the sake of the customers it really is shameless and baffling how he can continue giving statements that make zero sense and contribute nothing towards an outcome for any of this thats why i think he is being forced to go out there and do this and by forced i mean with the threat of physical harm because who would continue to publicly go out there and mumble excuses that do not explain a single thing his admissions are circular yet pointless and reads like a stall tactic to buy time for somebody else which obviously is not himself he knows hes fucked but lets continue babbling nothingness everyday like a designated patsy he is smarter than a pathetic excuse of i wasnt aware or in retrospect he is playing the dummy for sure but why and for who
7743,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,sbf must eat crayons
7744,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,i can’t wait for the south park episodes on all this

7747,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,did i hear him right when he basically said  billion is too small to be on his radar
7748,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,it is no mystery what happened to the missing money alameda gave it to ftx in exchange for ftt tokens they lost most or all of the tokens on risky bets and ftx didn’t have enough dry powered to bail them out it’s a tale as old as time
7749,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,coffee asked the right questions
7750,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,thanks for posting this  interesting interview

7752,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,this dude is spinning a story of ignorance going to be a while but can’t wait to see what unravels in court
7753,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,if sbf keeps on doing these interviews hes gonna slip up or contradict himself at some point assuming he hasnt alreadymust be a prosecutors wet dream
7754,zckket,2022-12-04 20:26:20,it still surprises me that this guy isnt in prison

8374,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,this was coordinated right after the bankruptcy to disappear the remaining assets they should all be in jail for the rest of their lives
8375,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,so what’s to stop something like this happening with coinbase“whoops we accidentally withdrew  from all our customer’s bank accounts  must have been a hack  no you’re definitely not exit liquidity…”
8376,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,only the terminallynaive would believe its been hackedzack voell appears to be among them
8377,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,this is a friendly reminder that kraken support will never dm you first ask for your username or password or ask you to transfer funds kraken has its own subreddits  and  and their ping for verified users associated with kraken ukrakenluna ukrakenpluto ukrakenvali am a bot and this action was performed automatically please messagecomposetorcryptocurrency if you have any questions or concerns
8378,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,so i went to the website but used a secure browser in theory
8379,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,coincidence 🤣🤣  meanwhile sbf soaking in the rays drinking a sex on the beach in bahamas
8380,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,wow they should make this into a movie
8381,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,this is the final step before wiping all records done by hackers coincidentally just days after the elections are done where sam was using these customer funds to continue donating to political campaigns and lobbying groups
8382,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,things like this is exactly why there needs to be so oversight  problem is issues like this will cause overreacting when creating laws regarding it
8383,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,hacked 😂 what a fucking joke someone and his girlfriend made some spare keys for the back door
8384,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,so it begins… for the  time this year
8385,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,	ftx and ftx us are two seperate corporate entities it is impossible that a hacker would have access to both of their servers keys and backupsincorrect assumption yes they are distinct business entities but they absolutely can and do share technology this is incredibly common in the tech world for tax and regulatory purposes keep the users separate but the tech is identical and may or may not even be in different data centers
8386,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,are macsios safe i went to the site briefly this morning just to check on my last transfer i got most of it out several days ago and quickly backed out when i saw the news no suspicious transfers on any of my accounts so far but just want to be safe
8387,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,thank god i’ve never used ftx
8388,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,how does their site give you a trojan do you need to login or anyone linked will get infected
8389,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,this so wild just thinking about how much money that is
8390,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,the plot thickens
8391,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,did i follow that main wallet correctly and see that the “ftx sucks” coin that got created and sent there also just rugged all its holders lol
8392,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,inside job
8393,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,so… what you’re really saying is to short ftt 👍
8394,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,accidentally opened it for a sec while trying to delete on ios how much risk does that place one in for the malware
8395,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,the plot thiccens
8396,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,this shot has navigated right into my heart
8397,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,you know it kinda seems like i should just stay out of cryptobitcoin altogether and just put my money in the local credit union…
8398,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,democratz
8399,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,propaganda mashine turn on
8400,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,greed gets rekt by greed 👌🙌
8401,ysyt5a,2022-11-12 06:43:54,maybe hitler was onto something 🤡
8651,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,is poor management a euphemism for theft
8652,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,pretty sure lots of people are blaming ftx
8653,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i must be consuming different media than you  everything i’ve readheard has put this entirely on them since the beginning
8654,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,media is complicit
8655,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the guy is a thief pure and simple he should be compared with bernie madoff not donald trump
8656,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,so were just gonna ignore that op is using an opinion article as their evidence ok
8657,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,poor management fraud
8658,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,you and a lot of other people here need to read that article much more carefully youre completely misinterpreting what lost confidence in him means here and youre wildly mischaracterizing the rest of the piece  lets take the lost confidence in him thing the wsj isnt saying poor sbf if only his customers had believed in him then everything would have worked outtheyre saying ftx collapsed because of essentially a bank run everyone tried to pull their money out at once because they were worried with good reason that it was stored in an insolvent institutionin other words his supporters lost confidence in him again there are valid reasons which they acknowledge for why they lost confidence but that was the immediate cause of the collapse thats all theyre  for the rest of the piece its clear and explicit in condemning sbf here are some direct quotes sbf betrayed his supporters sbf hasnt owned up to or apologized for his deceptions a sycophantic press    disregarded the glaring red flags about mr bankmanfriedin what way is any of that not blaming himyou also complain that the article doesnt acknowledge the fact that they were using customer funds for their own gambles welp good news it does heres another quotemr bankmanfried assured customers that his exchange would safeguard their deposits as it lent out more than half of them to his alameda research trading house to fund risky betsim not sure why so many people are intent on creating the impression that the media is trying to let sbf off the hook but if this is the best proof youve got it might be time to rethink that narrative
8659,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,yet he remains free he must actually be a banker
8660,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,that attempted cardano shill is a reminder of why we shouldn’t trust people on social media either
8661,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,problem is not the money he stole for material things most of that money can be recovered its the money that went to almeda and is lost through bad investments that money is gone forever
8662,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,it was a slush fund for democrats people need to go to prison
8663,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,becuase the media is a left wing institution mostly and sbf buttered the bread of democrats to the tune of  of millions of dollarsits actually stunning how openly they are covering for him
8664,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,because the media is owned by people in politics who got donation from sbf
8665,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,and they don’t talk enough about this goddamn sex tape i want to see so badly
8666,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i think u mean since  when the federal reserve was established 
8667,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,“ftx failed because sam bankmanfried’s supporters lost confidence in him” that’s literally how ponzi schemes work ftx was a ponzi scheme
8668,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,they are all paid off
8669,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the media has definitely blamed ftx and sbf every day since it melted down looking at  or  opinion articles and hopping to thinking that the media is like some unified crime organisation is really tinfoil hat talk
8670,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,its literally an opinion articleit says   opinionin multiple spotsits not meant to be a completely objective and neutral point of view its just someones opinionhave any of you ever worked in communications or somewhere where people feature news columns by certain writers get over urselfs
8671,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is definitely not true of all media outlets there are tons of articles blaming the right people to prove your point you would literally have had to have read every article addressing the collapse and they would all have to be whitewashing the issue for you to be right instead you are cherrypicking one opinion piece to try and prove your point
8672,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the media is blaming everyone for the ftxcrash except ftx and sbf themselvesnope wrong that is unless you only see the world or in this case the media in a binary sense  and still then only if you ignore countless examples that contradict your theory
8673,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,im not sure who the bots are behind these posts but no matter how many times you put them up anyone can just pull up a web search of ftx and see that almost all the coverage is negative
8674,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,who isnt blaming the people making the decisions im blaming sbf and i hope everyone with common sense is too
8675,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,if you havent noticed yet hes not going to prison
8676,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the problem is the bad actors like ftxit is infuriating that it’s crypto that gets the blame while the issue is manly centralized bad actors fake news media useless mainstream and corrupt politicians
8677,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i blame sbf personally
8678,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,because its tied to the democrats and ukrained funneling our tax money into ftx back to dems
8679,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the media lol yall need to stop cherry pickinghow sam bankmanfried’s crypto empire collapsednew chief calls ftx’s corporate control a ‘complete failure
8680,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,welcome to  years ago ain’t nothing been right since 
8681,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,wlecome to reality its been like that for a while now consider other things you thought to be true that were a lie almost all the talking heads told you cardano was garbage ask why
8682,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the only spot for sam is jail  this is straight up fraud on investors  the sec asleep at the wheel again  time to fire gensler  he’s worried about ripple but not ftx   million stolen from investors to buy bahamas real estate  was that in prospectus
8683,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the media is so fucking stupid it cant be a coincidence i start to believe the conspiracy theories
8684,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i blame ftx
8685,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,uh youre on the media youtube is the media cnbc is the media everyone is blaming samsaying otherwise basically is saying you just see what you want to seethe most lol part about the lobbying is he didnt even get anything from it all of the democrats and republicans he donated to basically kept his money or they have tried to distance themselves and he got nothing for it
8686,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is like the  identical post on the matter all citing irrelevant opinion articles and all  of them are pointing to an imaginary conspiracy please stop
8687,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,real journalism is pretty much dead msm is a mouth piece for the rich and powerful
8688,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,sbf has donated a shit ton of money to politicians and political parties which run the media
8689,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,you need to improve your reading comprehension because i’ve read plenty of articles that put the blame squarely on sbf and that little caroline ellison at alameda and their non record keeping lack of management
8690,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,they protect their own dems and the mainstream media are all in cahoots
8691,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,its not cryptos fault that a company chose to steal from its customers
8692,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the media is blaming everyone for the ftxcrash except ftx and sbf themselves for their poor management and extensive lobbyingbecause everyone else except ftx and sbf didnt donate customer funds to politicians for their election campaign and lobbyingnews outlet are so biased these days they are basically puppet of the parties they follow this goes for both spectrums democrats and republicans
8693,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,reply your funny ideas to catch the ftx hacker
8694,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,yall obsessed with the mainstream media changed the narrative from what sbf was actually up to
8695,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,deja vu didnt you make this post before already
8696,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,everyone blames them
8697,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,ow boy even more ftx posts so happy
8698,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,did you miss the label opinionalso hes not free the guy isnt going anywhere feds dont get involved until the collapse
8699,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,we are in dark times when elon is the voice of reason in the room
8700,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,so maybe trump was right about everything all along
8701,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is what happens when your daddy is well connected
8702,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this smells like political conection in some way
8703,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,fuck the media
8704,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,another small fun fact if we are already herethe wsj article post on twitter has been factchecked and a new discription has been addedit states that it was a complete failure of cooperate control and there was a complete absence of trustworthy financial information furthermore saying there is no connection between sbf and trumpwsj is getting roasted completely from twitter right now and rightfully so
8705,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,democrats
8706,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i can tell in that picture sbf is whining like a little girl
8707,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,wish everyone would just stop clicking on these sites and let them rot
8708,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,instead of accusing supporters of turning away from someone you should probably be asking what the individual did to cause a change of heart
8709,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,in a parallel universe sbf is still fking allison and not our lives
8710,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,relevant contrast to how sbf is treated vs portnoy
8711,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,hilarious ftx failed because his supports lost confidence yea couldn’t be the using of customer funds through a back door to keep alameda looking solvent couldn’t be all the loans he and his lackeys took out for basically nothing
8712,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,not poor management outright crime all the upper management from all their facade companies in the group should get at least  years of prison timebut they are rich well connected nothing will ever happen
8713,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i promise you that we are all blaming sbf like every single one of us…
8714,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,those who are in crypto knows what actually happened but whats puzzling is why the media seems to be protecting or covering up for fft dirt feels like the general public who does not have a clue about crypto is being fed a whole lot of misinformation
8715,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,ironically alyssia finley is a conservative opinion writer known for being antivax  the wall street journal is owned by news corp
8716,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this happens with so many different things and it drives me nuts mass shootings for example
8717,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the best scam is the one that keeps getting bigger until it blows up in your faceironically hell probably make millions again in future selling interviewmovie rights etcimagine the nft of his mugshot would fetch a pretty penny
8718,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i don’t know how anyone ever at ftx thought that allowing users up to  margins on account holdings was a good idea how would this not have ended horribly if every crypto everywhere absolutely mooned 
8719,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the media that are producing fluff pieces are probably owned by the powerful entities that received donations from ftx
8720,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i think its going to get real murky in the coming weeks not sure many people will be willing to  accept the truths that are exposed
8721,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,coffeezilla has a good video on the deflected blame by the media
8722,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is an opinion piece from some random person it does not mean anything
8723,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i’ve been following this very closely and i’m very interested to see how this is going to shake out for sbf the thing is i don’t see what’s so ingenious about his scam it’s a tale as old as time he moved around consumer funds without their knowledge he created his own coin that he used as actual capital to back deals… he basically was just another stupid kid who took advantage of the infancy of crypto in a wild west sort of way there’s a million of these guys i cannot for the life of me understand how someone heard that he was playing league of legends on a call and took it as a positive sign it all just feels like nobody looked too closely at him and he relied on a lot of glitz and glamor to make his operation look legit
8724,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,just one more data point to keep in mind when they report about anything and especially when  framing their something as misinformation
8725,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,initially it was bitcoin crashing that caused the fallout of ftc and others  cause and effect
8726,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,ftx fuck them extremely
8727,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is true that thieving asshole stole all that money but what do they do blame crypto like muthafucka he stole billions of dollars how is that cryptos problem hes the one that caused everything
8728,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,now that hes shitting all over esg calling it a day and a hoax it stands to make a lot of people look foolish which has become a fate worse than death when did society suddenly decide that its never ok to admit you were wrong about anything or anyone insane
8729,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is a weird take on what happened
8730,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,drs gme moass is the only way
8731,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,too many people accepting his money
8732,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i dunno everything i’ve read blames him and management pretty explicitly for their wrong doings
8733,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,turns out  just like ftx had no accountant these media companies also dont have competent writers
8734,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,yeah bro its my fault because i read about it
8735,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the advertising media became paid political actors when the covid stimulus began politicians funneled money to their donors and power actors to control the narrative it was an unprecedented all out blitzkrieg and marketing campaign
8736,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,well americans dont agree on whether there are two or more genders the whole nation is in a frenzy of decadence so to be honest it doesnt surprise me
8737,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i didn’t buy this ticket just here to watch it play out and eat popcorn
8738,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,media used sbf for trp when ftx was at its peak media is using sbf for trp when the ftx collapse  ftx account holders got effed up in between
8739,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,or better depending on which ticket you bought for the show
8740,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,look heres the thing and it is discussed in this post too everyone is blaming ftx and sbf for being the fraudulent manipulative entities that they were but there are other parties involved in this too that make you question the whole business scene associated with crypto firstly i still fail to understand the investors that simply fell prey to the hype and went ahead with millions in investment without any due diligence i dont think they would afford the same leeway to other startups that have far more integrity secondly and i know its a difficult topic but some regulation around crypto businessescrypto exchanges has to be implemented people like sbf are going to continue to find new ways to build hype create fomo trap everyone and get away with everyones money
8741,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,also poor management poor management is what the vcs did though i guess ftx and sbf did poorly manage their con and fraud
8742,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,its hard to get the whole context for this excerpt but it appears to be suggesting that sbf is merely a con man who could have continued conning under the right circumstances i dont think it is trying to hide anything or show him in a good light it just seems nuanced and probably written by someone who is very used to writing about the world of corruption so is not interested in stating the obvious but trying to take a bit of a different angle on the implications of how someone gets themselves into a position like this and how their downfall can happen
8743,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,all i see is the media blaming sbf lol
8744,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,but it is all fine as long as cnn still has more than  different articles about trump on the first page
8745,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i mean thieves and scammers exist everywhere right if a scammer manages to somehow hack ur private wallet of course the scammer is an asshole but youre to blame for not ensuring the safety of your wallet we literally all let ftx go unchecked the users the regulators the people involved with them etc
8746,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is a none event for the market stop fear mongering g
8747,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,they are precisely to be blamedsbf is the main actor
8748,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,its nothing short but insane how much the traditional media is manipulating and hiding facts that are already public knowledge and some were even admitted by the criminals themselves i now trust independent twitter journalism more than any other news source
8749,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,you think gensler will get fired cute  i would be shocked if anyone gets fired or prosecuted we’ll see in  mos what happens i’ll bet you a stack of oreos it’s a nothing burger
8750,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,seems like the jackass in charge and his disaster  girlfriend are obviously at fault here
8751,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,you pulled one tweet and called it the media more like one cherry picked opinion article…
8752,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,mm is often wrong but i also believed they were good intentioned at the end of the day but sbf incident really exposed that they dont care if its one of themthe mm is more dangerous than the other media outlets because in many peoples minds they are still goodintentioned
8753,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47, arrests  warrants  seizures  media on bahamas  press conf from sec doj sdny ny ag edny or anyone else
8754,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,ftx flipped one trading firm’s risk obsession disaster followed  this is from bloomberg today i dont think it is about risk it is plain corruption and theft
8755,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47, it is clear that the article now at least knows that there were mistakes made at ftx and with sbf causing this debacle but are not really pointing out how sbf was filling his own pockets and lobbied to the white house with the money of customers tooevery article mentioned the alleged problems and one you posted about was a health opinion not financial news also you are cherry picking there was another nyt article that breaks down what they know about the collapse actually named the collapse of ftx so i would recommend looking for articles in the finance section about this not in pandemic news and then claiming thats the only article the times has published about this this is just a qanon level of bullshit misinformation about the msm yet again the ties with regulators the media cover up yall sound like election deniers honestly just ignorant shit
8756,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,if i could be forced to decide one between trump and sbf i choose trump without any time spending
8757,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,everyone that had money in ftx essentially contributed to the democratic campaign your money used as political donations in order to get sbf off the hook
8758,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i’m sure hollywood already has the movie written that depicts sam as the victim and the beat goes on
8759,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,correction some media
8760,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,these are thieves nothing more  they were all brought up in nice families and then turned into bullshit artists  they created multiple shell companies to extract additional value and would have continued their grift if not for the market implosion  they’ll tell you it was all to help the world be a better place  they’re just another tulip 🌷
8761,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47, of what the mainstream media says is fictional the real sad story is how not enough people have figured that out  just expect everything on msm to be the twisted narrative of what global elites want you to think and you can use msm as a way to understand their goals  nothing on nyt wsj cbs msnbc cnn etc is going to be true anymore its a shame but these institutions have long ago sold their integrity for dollars
8762,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,gee wonder if it has to do with nepotism in his family 🤣🤣🤣
8763,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,it reminds me of when clinton lost and she blamed everything but her and still does
8764,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,and everyone walking free so far   must be some leftie launder deal
8765,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,good job i didnt borrow and go all in on crypto
8766,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,let it be known that i blame ftx
8767,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,ftx top  biden donators
8768,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the fearmongering continues   in the meantime markets continue grinding higher
8769,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,some body or multiple people need to be in jail andor fined for this
8770,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,sbf might be hiding stolen funds in a decentralized platform where no government can access …… benefits of a decentralized solutions
8771,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,hey crypto is risky i’m sure these account holders knew the risks  you want decentralization you got it
8772,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,and once again warning signs everywhere yet regulators asleep at the wheel  probably bought off  too much corruption
8773,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,its cryptos fault
8774,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,poor management and theft did them in
8775,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,sigh its people like this that make me miss hitler
8776,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,most news today is wokeist biased garbage mainstream news has been corrupted on both sides
8777,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i got banned from r news when i pointined out the medias failure on this then blocked when i asked what rule i broke
8778,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,
8779,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,sad truth is that a lot in finance operates just like ftx just maybe on a less chaotic levelbut so far i have not really seen a lot of outlets who did not blame sbf for what happened the only person who had a role in what happened who is not attacked by the media is czsure he was right about ftx being overleveraged and risky but every trader knows that dumping a billion worth of a token at once is going to dump the price and not yield the seller the best result cz deliberately took a hit on his investment just to make the point that him selling all at once would cause billions in losses for investorsbut wsj sbf cz and elon musk are pretty much the same untrustworthy type and nothing either of those say is worth the storage space their texts occupy on hard drives
8780,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,media blame others but the people blame ftx and sbf the peoples opinions are all we need if you ask me
8781,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,stopping using the term crypto would help
8782,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,not the media but the corporate media
8783,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,holy hell wsj trump must be living rent free in the brains of all their employees what the fuck they must have something like a quota to insert trump name every other sentence
8784,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,just even more proof that our media companies are broken and cater to agendas the ones who line their pockets
8785,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,the neocons are fuming they have lost their golden boy to impose ofac sanctions at the protocol level every other major exchange has come out against imposing ofac sanctions at the protocol level coinbase has even publicly said they rather shut down their validator than impose sanctionssbf was their ticket to expand their filthy hands to exacerbate the misery of the downtrodden
8786,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,its almost like blaming ftx would also implicate certain other people similar to how indicting andrew cuomo on his insertion of covid patients into nursing homes and then covering it up reflected poorly on his entire partys covid stance so instead they wrung him up on sexual harassment charges
8787,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,there was a choice made somewhere where you decided to camp out your crypto on a cex
8788,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,in addition search the forbes article dude gave to both democrats and republicans  don’t let the bozos lay the blame on one another they are both complicit  greedy apes both sides
8789,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,i wouldn’t be surprised if it came out that they have a vested interest in ftx or other crypto investments
8790,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,well if you make enough donations you will control the media
8791,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,that scammed millions of people for  see to scam million people for million you need just a  from each man sbf is just a neutral biography guy who donated to right causes are you sorry for  donation for a good guys
8792,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,because they are protected by the gov
8793,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,they will be looking to downplay this and to bury it as soon as opportunity arises the sad thing is society has such short attention span nowadays that it will actually work and the only message non crypto people will get from all of this will be magic internet money  bad
8794,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,sfb knows where the bodies are hidden and who took the bribes in dcthe same cabal owns the mediaso now you know
8795,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,strange not to see people bash elon here isnt everything he says wrong
8796,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,hell w the mediathe government needs to hold the founder and his house elf responsible in whatever means possible jail or serious penalties
8797,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,wtf trump has to do with this is he involved with ftx does he even deal with crypto
8798,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,wef took this sbf there to destroy cryptoits all planned ba globalist deep state
8799,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,jesus christ can they say or do anything without mentioning trump ffs
8800,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,he donated to politicians hes being media whitewashed hes not going to jail
8801,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,joe biden literally had input in writing that article to deflect any mention of himself and villainies his old pal trump what a scandal i think this should be called sbfgate
8802,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,he was a democrat mega donor there is zero chance the media holds him accountable and doesn’t publish puff pieces about all the “good” sbf did using his customers funds
8803,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,this is how “the big con” works …
8804,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,guy steals millions using msm as cover  msm this is bitcoins faultmsm is literally propaganda at this point  there really need to be regulation … in journalism
8805,z1ykgp,2022-11-22 16:54:47,allot of the big left official media is rallying to defend some aspect of sbf they clearly are bought off but we all knew that didnt we just proves it yet again just keep pointing it out when you see it
8985,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,hot potato  i’m guessing his mom will take care of him

9046,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,wolf of wall street of the xxi century
9047,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,actually he crossed a lot more people from other countries than from us  these people would be happy to get a hold of him  us prison is the safest place for him
9048,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,most of the south american countries have extradition laws and agreements with the usa a simple google search would have told him beforehand i thought he was a genius… from what people said here…
9049,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,i heard that he was flying to argentina what happened did his plane made an u turnthis guy is screwed on so many levels

9057,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,dont trust the argentinian goverment they are a bunch of rats and i say it as an argentinian they would sell your kids for money
9058,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,deporting him to us that’s where he was collaborating and making all the ponzi schemes with us and ukraine taking him to us will help him escape the case
9059,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,faith in humanity restored thank you argentina
9060,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,fuck i dont wanna live through historical events anymore
9061,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,basado y pill de rojo
9062,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,do kwon didnt mean to steal to at least what kind of human is this guy anyway
9063,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,sam bankman rekt
9064,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,the discount samwise gamgee
9065,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,this guy needs to be behind bars
9066,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,last week police arrested him in singapore or bahamas was it a fake news
9067,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,get shorty
9068,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,im not buying this if news outlets could be trusted there are quite a lot of smuggling events happening in argentina if this is true it wont be hard for  rich guy like sbf to enter the country
9069,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,war criminals did it with less money
9070,yti13k,2022-11-12 20:52:15,if they truly wanted to arrest him it would have been more helpful if they didn’t announce it in advance
9202,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,its all good guys he is really fucking sorry
9203,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,they intentionally used ftt for an infinite money scheme in which they used their own artificially propped up token as collateral to borrow legitimate funds ftx lends ftt to alameda  alameda uses the ftt as collateral to borrow funds  alameda pumps ftt with those funds  repeatthe result a ponzi scheme bound to crash into the grounddont apologise as if you made a mistake there was no mistake here this was intentional fraud
9204,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,everybodys saying its an infinite money glitch and it seems on point make your own exchange token provide liquidity and a price floor to make it look valuable and loan real money against it how that isnt anything other than fraud and how it wasnt detected is a mystery to me
9205,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,if he cant make the customers whole i think there will be heavy criminal charges because in this case contrary to what happened with the previous insolvencies there is fund misappropriation this isnt an hack and customers retain ownership when they deposit in an exchange however there is still a path to make the customers whole it all depends on where the market go from now onbeside i think that hole may be shrinking because of customers liquidation inside ftx most derivatives there are becoming illiquid futures are going crazy i bet there is a lot going on behind the scenes closing positions is difficult in this environment and customers cant post more collateral and shouldnt do it anyway at this stage
9206,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,to my loyal employeesyou have always been my lowest priority and continue to be
9207,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,you know you are desperatedelusional when you hope justin sun is going to be your saviourone of the scummiest guys around even by shitcoin standards
9208,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this looks like it was planned to be leaked for pr  emphasis on “ customers” where was this thought for the customers when he was gambling with your money
9209,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,cant wait to see the wallets where this sob has cashed out before halting withdrawals and those where he dumped ftt and sol on retail fucking pos
9210,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,never ever trust a single word that comes out of these snakessbf was only recently lobbying in congress in front of lawmakers many of whom hed bought lying through his teeth about gfc leverage ponzis and how ftx risk profile was completely transparentwatch the genius who invented all this released everything for free and disappeared without fanfare today were every day talking about which celebrity founder ceo influencer are good guys and bad guysan invention gifted to humanity  we are arguing which humans can or cannot be trusted we have truly come such a long way and gone back to the future were all gonna make it boys
9211,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this smacks to me of an internal communication that was written with it being leaked in mind i just can’t see a way of ftx surviving this an exchange doesn’t use its clients funds for its own speculative investments an exchange doesn’t borrow against its own issued tokens to further that speculative investment using these tokens and clients money as collateral you ring fence your clients funds they aren’t yours and if you don’t and it all blows up in your face be prepared to go to trial and face up to the consequences of your actionsor you could just act like an exchange should and not have to engage in this epic fud to try and cover your back the forensic analysis of the smart contracts and transactions on chain aren’t going to be easy to explain away that’s for sure
9212,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,dont you guys worry what well do is use tron as collateral for loans and make the customers whole
9213,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,if you look carefully you could translate it asfuck you employees good luck finding a new job

9216,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,sbf is a shady mf and so is everyone on his executive team if you’re sat in a boardroom discussing strategy and that strategy is to artificially prop up your cex by loaning out your native token to an affiliated entity alameda and that entity uses those tokens as collateral to borrow and circle that back around to the cex you’re directly involved in running a multi billion dollar racket and you should be calling your lawyer criminal activities in the crypto space need to be dealt with swiftly and with little to no lenience these people have caused so much pain through their illegal activities and should be held responsible
9217,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,to be honest the whole crypto sphere looks like a big fucking scam how many collapses we had in  super solid projects super solid platforms at the end is all the same shit ponzis after ponzis rugs scams everywhere all these supposed crypto kings playing with peoples money deposits withdrawals crypto at the end the ones always fucked are the regular folks trying to make a little progress in their life in the meantime we are the laughing stock in all markets no one will take crypto serious with all these  shitty characters and while the idea of all this is decentralisation it means we will always have this in the space
9218,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,bahamian ops yes because bahamaianbased corporations and lawful compliance have such a storied history together 🙄

9221,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this fraud should be behind bars yesterday throw him in before he pulls a do kwon and runs away with his tail between his legs
9222,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,sbf is a fraud scammer who manipulated his own customers funds using his handprinted ftt token and sister firm alameda he deserves jail nothing less
9223,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,lol he wants to make a raise from possible new investors so basically he wants to pay the old investors with the new investors money sounds like a ponzi to me 😂

9235,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,why are all these billionaire wunderkind ceos borderline illiterate
9236,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,the weird thing for me is that as a major exchange youre basically printing money so this is just to make more than that already shitton youre raking in greedy fuckers
9237,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this guy was always so full himself but hell have money stashed away whilst customers and his employees suffer he needs to go to jail karma
9238,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,sun is concerned about the ftx investors because if ftx collapses it will take down a huge chunk of the crypto ecosystem with it ftx like a lot of crypto is a greater fool scheme which sam has pretty much indicated publiclyyou can see the light at the end of the tunnel and its a train boys
9239,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,conducting a raisewho tf is going to put money into this shit now

9244,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,the worst part of this whole charade is the intentional and unnecessary publicity they gave it just as the market was recoveringmarket manipulation a la mode
9245,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,fuck this ronald mc donald looking fucker hope he gets what he deserves
9246,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,he is putting his customers first only because he doesn’t want to go to jail he doesn’t give a shit about doing what’s morally right if he cared about his customers he wouldn’t have rekt them for years
9247,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,maybe we dont need a sam bankmanfried or justin sun or cz to bail out crypto markets maybe we dont need billionaires running exchanges holding lions share of supply  setting price  that kind of sounds like our modern central banking systemmaybe we just need honest exchanges dex  smart contractsdecentralized  that was the idea from the beginning
9248,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,hey guys i’ll use the money i have left mainly from my robinhood investment and flee only to start another company with do kwon
9249,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,pssh i would quit on the fucking spot especially if only the execs knew anything once an investigation starts you won’t want to know anything better to just say i quit as soon as i found out

9253,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,to be honest every cex could have major issues behind the scenes but this again is a strong indicator that you should never leave your coins on an exchange for long
9254,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i guess one of our political parties  only the  million he gave in the midterms

9275,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,probably looking for the best place to go hide before getting on the red alert list
9276,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,many employees also have funds on ftx so they have also been fucked by sbf    no way the employees didnt know whats happening
9277,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,scumbag keeps lying
9278,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,“i used your money and lost it following a string of bad decisions but i want to do right by you please give generously”  sbf probably
9279,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,remember theres only less than  million btcs left id assume on exchanges books theyre going to lie about it by turning btc into an infinite number when the end time approaches
9280,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,and yet my bank blocks me from using binance 
9281,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,imagine talking with justin sun as a plan tron will fall next
9282,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,returning customer funds is only his number  priority because he knows if he doesnt hes gonna be boarding with do kwon

9286,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,ye saw this on twitter earlier some anon shared it
9287,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,it was working until it wasn’t
9288,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this whole thing is horrible for everyone involved yes even sbfhe gambled and lostthis truly is a black swan event for the industry as a wholegoing forward i genuinely believe that things will never be the same…but that is for the betterthe whole point of the original “mainstream” crypto bitcoin was to eliminate the middle man central banks which we could also call centralized exchanges like ftx at this pointyet people still want to trust themevents like these change that for smart moneyi remember when the robinhood saga happened with them halting trading on gamestopi learned then i only was dabbling in investing then so i did not lose a ton of money never trust a centralized exchange even though that was with fiat and this is crypto there are similaritiesgoing forward here are my thoughts even though i’m new to crypto i’m a quick learner and become obsessed over things i really want to learn so here  not your keys not your  defi and dex’s are the future for crypto find a dex you like and learn how to use it flawlessly this is where the smart money will go in the  it’s okay to use cex’s but only as a method of transportation getting in or cashing out positions after that  cold  place only partial trust in any centralized power if you cannot verify what they are saying they are doing best to not trust themlastly i will sayi love this communitythe whole idea of defi is a beautiful thing don’t let a few bad actors ruin it for youwith freedom comes responsibility and the need for constant vigilanceall that being said…i’m buying more but you best believe it’s going on my ledgerlike nathan rothschild said “when there is blood running through the streets i buy”good luck allwe will get through this and come out stronger on the other sideedited for typos
9289,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,justin sun seems interested in helping out    oh boy     idk why but i like how this is going    justin and cz are self serving in this context kinda excited for the coming months    im willing to bet their trying to build ftx up again and pull back last minute like what elon tried to do twitter but i dont think there are legalities with crypto exchanges cmiiw though
9290,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,came here to say get your fucking crypto off the exchanges having your money held in a centralised exchange is worse that having your money in a bank if you want to hold crypto download a cold storage wallet it only takes  mins to set up
9291,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,holy balls omfg i fear the crypto space
9292,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,justin sun’s stablecoin usdj is looking a hell of lot stronger compared to the likes of usdd usdn or even gusd

9297,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,soooo my sol withdrawal is yet to complete nothing for  days now do you think we will see any of that money
9298,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,sbf knowingly doing what he did is plain and simple fraud i think i see some shiny bracelets that require a key to open in his future
9299,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i just never understand why they don’t just run right when the machine is at its peak take the money and run if you are a scumbag but be a decent scum bag at least
9300,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,looks like fraud to me  lock’m up
9301,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,the greed and deception of man absent of moral code knows no bounds
9302,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this letter reads as if a young kid wrote it horribly put together and if i’m being real the whole vibe it’s giving off is that he wrote it while taking a shit tell me this ain’t fooling anyone here please i’m sorry wtaf a raise lololololololso if you translate what he wrote into actual coherent thought he wants other people to give him money because he has none anymore prison he deserves to be sending letters like this from prison
9303,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,some thoughts  he wrote it knowing it would be leaked  or he didnt write it why is there a cursor in the first graphic and you cant fuck your employees or theyll sue you for sexual harassment
9304,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this smells so bad hopefully get resolved without crashing and affecting users

9311,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this is beyond bad for the space its why we need regulation as much as im meh on it we also do not need   exchangesim sorry we  will never happen until there is regulation another sbf is waiting going to be hard to trust people in this space for a while
9312,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,ooo if tron belly ups  btc here we go
9313,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,the dominoes continue to fall   buyers beware

9315,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,written under duress but that writing style makes my eyes bleed
9316,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,he just had to include his desire to eventually pay himself out in there 🙄 come on bro
9317,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,wouldn’t hold my breathe they raise any outside funding the hole is too big and the company too toxic vc will avoid this like the plague now if justin sun is your last hope good luck i’d say there is a  chance they raise anything above 
9318,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this is going to keep happening until there is real regulatory improvement in the space people keep saying the market will flush out the bad actors no it won’t there will always be the next scum bag in line
9319,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,this was the def of a ponzi scheme…
9320,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,so he conducted a  ponzi scheme why are we demanding jail time for do kwon but not for this asshole
9321,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i am very confident he did not know anybody would leak this email 😂
9322,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i want a stream with martin shkreli do kwon and sbf
9323,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,it really is amazing how the core principals of bitcoin where it all started are nonexistent now these giant crypto organizations have become an even worse form of banks the very thing they promise to not be it’s so easy for users to simply take their funds off the exchange but greed is a powerful drug honestly we don’t deserve to be treated with any respect and people saying crypto is a scam are absolutely right our credibility is lost as an industry and we deserve the pain that comes with it why just why would you not use crypto for the very thing it was created for why do you shill crypto and all it’s amazing benefits if you don’t use them
9324,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,it’s things like these that are going to get crypto regulated into the ground
9325,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,send him to jail extradite him from bahamas
9326,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i’m suspicious when i see lots of sentences beginning with stuff like “let me start by saying” “the most important thing is” “first of all” “my number one priority is”they rarely add anything and it suggests a degree of timidity about how the ‘substance’ of your words will be received
9327,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,fuck him and his fucking letter what a total piece of shit youd have to be a complete moron to ever trust him again

9373,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i think the crypto world has been learning a lot of hard lessons over theast few days
9374,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01, they purposefully employed ftt for an infinite money scheme using their own token—which was artificially propped up—as collateral to borrow legal money
9375,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i always wondered how it was possible that there could be so much availability of coins to go around and do all this back and forth trading but it’s becoming more apparent that most of it is non existent
9376,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,i want to know why ftt ftx coin isnt fucking death now from  to  and now  why is that should be side by side with luna
9377,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01, they intentionally used ftt for an infinite money scheme in which they   used their own artificially propped up token as collateral to borrow   legitimate funds
9378,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,sbf should start a gofundme page
9379,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,most billionaire wealth is unrealized gains from stock or other assets  when the government says pay their fair share theyre wanting to tax unrealized gains the us had a progressive tax rate of

9384,yr8q57,2022-11-10 07:55:01,of course crypto is simply doing what the banks had been doing for decades crime
9726,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,here is the twitter threaddirect link to the declaration ill just copy paste whats in it since theres very little to  sbf to be investigated in the course of the bankruptcy sam bankmanfrieds hedge fund lent billions to sam bankmanfried paper bird is his entity so thats at least part of the answer of where the money went ftx says the fair value of all the crypto non stablecoins that ftx international holds is a mere  personal note they do have  bill in stable this was a mistake my bad seems like the chart is in thousands of dollars so they have  the ftx group did not maintain centralized control of its cash cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories this is mad stuff  i do not believe it appropriate for stakeholders or the court to rely on the audited financial statements as a reliable indication  the debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the ftx group as of the petition date in the bahamas i understand that corporate funds of the ftx group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisorsedit  sbf   nishad singh  ryan salame  take  it could be ftx just used alameda as a cover story quite possible these guys were not doing any trading and just stealing customer funds having alameda was a good cover story for them to use the moneyalso sbf is a sociopath
9729,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,money is being moved out quickly and swapped messages sent in eth domains from the hackers there is an update for all the apps as wellthe important thing is that you do not update the app none of the ftx related appsits in your interest to delete them and be very cautiouspeoples balances are being deleted and some big things are happening no clue how this will end or where this originated from it might be an inside job or a state actor who knows aspects of this hack are sloppy and other parts are very planned outso again do not update ftx apps you might lose a lot moreedit id also recommend people monitor any connected bank accounts or debitcredit cards for the next few months and use credit karma to make sure no new cc have opened under your name we dont know what customer data was stollenedit update my bank account has been accessed by ftx using plaid today please please remove ftx from accessing your account i was able to remove access by going into my chase app
9730,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, they cant pay back customers this means they stole customers funds ftx isnt a fucking bank they arent supposed to have fractional reserves they arnt allowed to lend out your assets they are an exchange they are supposed to have all customers funds covered  anything apart from this means they were committing  they inflated thier balance sheets this is simple enough if  is true then it means ftx is insolvent they cant pay back their creditors namely customers who they lied to that the funds were available alameda also inflated its blc sheet by increasing the value of its own assets thus pretending they are solvent a little company called enron did this too they used this inflated blc to get credit to gamble on crypto  they traded against their customers they were using the data from ftx buy and sell orders  plus your own money they took to move the market against you they used your own money to fuck you ftx was going to collapse regardless
9731,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ftx is the biggest collapse of a corporation since  and this comes after  billion in lost funds  and  it was also revealed that   this  route was used to move assets in the billions of dollars without triggering alerts to staff and external auditorscrypto markets will never be the same as the fallout of ftx is rising worries among legislators
9732,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,not sure how many of you this would help but figured i’d post it just in case silvergate the payment processor ftx used would pay for the refund they took the risk so it’s on them to refund this will help keep those deposits out of the bankruptcy fiasco  i didn’t know this until i saw it earlier today on bloomberg  this is for the us so ftx us but i assume other countries most likely have similar laws here is the link to the cfpb site so you can check it out for yourself if you want to  i hope everyone involved in all of this gets the best possible outcome crypto has been crazy lately stay strong all enjoy the weekend edit silvergate not silverfish
10233,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,is the private jet a corolla too

10238,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,so the “hack” was an inside job it appears was the “don’t go to the website and delete the app” also part of the scheme

10252,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,i read that earlier online   he was headed to dubai
10253,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,for those interested in the details heres the full text of the extradition treaty between the bahamas and the united statesheres a potentially relevant section from article  p  offense described in this article shall be an extraditable offense whether or not the offense was committed within the territory of the requesting state however if the offense was committed outside the territory of the requesting state extradition shall be granted if the law of the requested state provides for punishment of an offense committed outside of its territory in similar circumstances
10254,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,its ironic that his name is so close to scam bankruptfraud
10255,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,🍿

10259,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,i seriously doubt he was too dumb for that ftx employees seemed to all agree that he was a giga brainsadly enough its probably way more sinister than he just fucked up
10260,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,ladies and gentlemen we got him
10261,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,holy shit wild that this all unfolded in essentially a week

10265,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,the post title and headline are wildly different headline is actually sam bankmanfried is ‘under supervision’ in bahamas looking to flee to dubaithere was a rumor he tried to flee also it doesnt specify if hes been detained just that theyre under supervision
10266,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,watch carefully friends  this is where you see the power elites cover for each other  his parents and caroline ellisons parents connections are going to kick in soon  how they spin this will be interesting to see  could he get thrown to the wolves  maybe  but i suspect theyre going to try to find another fall guys  something to get the spotlight off their precious kids
10267,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,guarantee you he won’t go to prison just like every other billionaire that gets in trouble money talks sam walks

10272,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,if this is true then they are very behind on the curve
10273,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,i hope there are photos and videos
10274,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,reminds me of narco wars except its crypto wars 🤣

10276,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,why would you tweet where you are if you are going to try to flee this story is getting more and more ridiculous every 
10277,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,i believe he paid to have this news put out  dude has to much connections to people in high places to simply be arrested for stealing money from us poor peasants
10278,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,this has to be the most interesting week ive ever seen play out in crypto
10279,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,he induced all his employees to shove their net worths into an exchange he knew was about to rugbohemians were unable to withdraw  because whales paid employees to kycgetting detained with no physical harm wasn’t guaranteed prison time was all but assuredit’s illogical
10280,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,even elon said sbf was a fraud when he offered to chip in for the twitter buy
10281,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,technically speaking hethey weren’t insolvent until the cz chad move all this happened in a very little timeframe

10311,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,if that figure is true i can’t see how anyone could have sympathy for anyone giving this kind of money to any single point of failure agency much less someone like sbf and ftx
10312,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,surely south park will do an episode about this right
10313,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,change into your superman costume and fly out to the jet to see if it’s really him
10314,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,there was a  billion dollar hole literally no way cz was going to acquire ftx it guaranteed his capture and the immediate nuke on ftt there was also immediate safety risk because he screwed his own employees“that’s exactly what happened”
10315,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,the more you read about whats going on the more you realize that these people have gods complex the ceo of alameda research definitely thinks she could not do any wrong in her investment strategy
10316,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,that’s exactly what happened but everyone wants to complicated it to blame enter  letter gov agency because how could make so much money but be so fucking stupid
10317,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,that one sounds like bullshit i did found the original article which mentioned romantically involved and it was in context that they dated each other and thats it sounded more like himym then nerd sex orgies 
10318,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,honestly though like if im running a billion dollar business and you dont tell me exactly what youre gonna say before you go live and start making promised about what im gonna do in the next few minutes to hours then cya laterz

10358,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,he claims he wasnt fleeing yet initially he was on his way to argentina until they announced they would capture him and then all of a sudden he was in hawaii
10359,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,imagine having the opportunity to meet tom brady just to scam  million users
10360,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,sam where you goin bro  the question still lingers silently in the room
10361,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,either that or hes being moved around to protect his life
10362,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,nothing should surprise anyone in this space anymore we know sam had a back door to cook the financial books who knew who was on the books that would raise eyebrows if made public ftx was one of tethers largest customers tether is known to wash columbian cartel funds
10363,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,this isnt fair i trusted the experts and got burned
10364,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,i think you’re both right sam installed the back door and knew he was committing fraud but by the end alameda was so incompetent and mismanaged that he had no idea the scale of the losses or how fast shit was about to hit the fan
10365,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,the  investor and ceo of the cryptocurrency exchange ftx has funneled money to candidates aligned with his philanthropic vision of socalled effective altruism and pandemic preparedness while also giving large sums to democratic groups
10366,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,minimalist is one thing unkempt is another he always looked unkempt why would anyone trust him with their money i know looks arent everything but its important to project who you are and it seems he did
10367,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,why didnt almeda all in short ftt with the inside knowledge of insolvency to make all the money back
10368,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,this always blew my mind how could a world class finally tuned athlete stand to be in the presence of someone who so clearly lacked any self disciplineie fat slob and probably never exercised in his life it actually lended credibility having brady vouch for him
10369,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,me thinks he started off honest and the dark players he got involved with led him astray through fear coercion or somethin like that
10370,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,… is it really possible sam was just a massive moron who made the bahamas his base of operations and never left after becoming insolvent and watching massive outflows from ftx as ftt nukedi mean he called cz and admitted insolvency instead of just flying to dubai
10371,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,time to get verified mate… then it’s cheap at  bucks… you a bot
10372,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,sbf needs to be played by michael cera with a curly fro xd 
10373,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,it was a poor acting job where he was pretending to be upset about having to go on tiktok  its a bad staged skit
10374,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,sam bankman fried didn’t kill himself…well maybe he tried but investors want to see him as a prison gimp for a few decades
10375,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,hate to tell everyone but you are victims of one of the greatest ponzi and money laundering schemes in the modern era i think it is coming to light that dan friedberg is really at the center of this scam he being the chief regulatory officer of ftx was the mentor of sbf and also at the center of a huge online betting scandal at a company called ultimate bet you have been ripped off by friedman and a group of young folks who have very little experience running billions of dollars the writing was on the wall for a long time and much like madoff and other ponzi schemes they get exposed in severe downturns  i recommend you reevaluate your risk management process in the entire crypto space as you will unfortunately find out there are some very fundamental red flag exposures not only with the market makers and businesses in this ecosystem but also the inherent design center and architectural flaws in the technology itself that undermine its use as a currency the most glaring being that it can be stolen very easily without a secure audit trail i think everyone understands the concept of defi and the desire to not be beholden to sovereign banks but having an elegant technological solution practically implemented is a much harder and extremely difficult task  what is going on with ftx is starting to expose the vulnerabilities of this ecosystem to nefarious actors and flaws in the technical architecture  currencies in the traditional sense are currencies because the are a liquid and stable store of value with very low relative beta to other securities or assets  if you look at this space you find failures of both liquidity and store of value folks right now are finding out they may have lost all their holdings in a very small window of time and cannot access what holdings may remain btc itself has deflated over  in the last year that is a crash to get back to breakeven you would have to have a gain of over approximately  on your position from an investment perspective this is a complete disaster you also have to account for the opportunity cost of losing those funds that could have been invested somewhere elsei feel very sorry for all the people who have lost significant sums of their hard earned money what is happening is horrible for those folks and their families making money legitimately from investments is very difficult and takes hard work and experience even for the best and brightest there are innumerable hurdles to overcome not the least of which is the traditional old wall street industrial complex designed not to safely build for a retirement but to separate you from your money what these characters at ftx have done is criminal and shameful they plied on the all to common desire to make a quick buck by telling lies and a narrative that seemed to good to be true and it wasno one wants to book losses but booking small losses before they become big losses is one of the most important tenets of profitable investing i hope those who have been wronged by these thieves learn lessons that will make the future better for themselves everyone makes mistakes but to not learn from those mistakes is even more unfortunatenot sure if this article is behind their paywall but this piece does a more in depth look at what has likely gone on at ftx to get to this point ftx’s balance sheet was bad
10376,ytn3lg,2022-11-13 00:32:11,waiting for musk to follow suit someone ought to confiscate that shits private jet

10825,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,usdc    and related info are in the collapsed comments below pros and cons will change for every new post
10826,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its also baffling that do kwon is not even a wanted person and sbf is giving daily interviews
10827,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yes it’s extremely bafflinginstead he’s on a media tour with people who are heavily biased towards his causesthis is weird it gets weirder every day
10828,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,look how long it took them to charge holmes better to have a water tight case then screw it up by acting too fast
10829,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,man this guy knows as little about the law as most cryptobros dothis is a federal crimethey have   bring charges before a grand  have the grand jury indict  extradict him from the bahamasthey are on step 
10830,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,why does this baffle him its quite obvious what is going on its public knowledge
10831,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,when you give away  billion to steal  billion you cockblock a lot of fbi agents cia staffers congressmen and senators
10832,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,insulting yeah baffling no not really money makes you almost  immune to the law
10833,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,well the more sbf talks the more of an evidence grave he is digging
10834,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i am also confused why is he still walking free
10835,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it does take a while to build a case for each specific charge and i imagine they aren’t even entirely sure of the entire scope yet mostly due to the crypto space being relatively new without a mature process for prosecution and intermingling of funds
10836,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,sam made a lot of political donations and ftx had some interesting customers so he’s likely protected
10837,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i agree brian
10838,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,steal  billion and nobody looks at you steal a candy bar at a storeand go to jailmakes sense
10839,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,lol the one guy trying to make an honest business out of crypto i respect him for that
10840,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,lookup who his parents are and its not surprising at all he is parading around freely
10841,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i love how quickly people who supposedly got into crypto to promote freedom are falling over themselves to advocate for the kidnapping of a person from a foreign country without due processthis coin base guy must know that it takes time to build a case for arrest and extradition yet he’s shocked shocked that sbf is still freecould it be that he’s shitting his pants and virtue signaling  oh my company isn’t like ftx at all  if sbf was standing in front of me i would punch him in the face…
10842,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,maxine waters is so appreciative of their candid discussions  the corruption gets me sick  they stole our money
10843,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,what dont we want regulationwhat do we wantprosecutionwhat do we getsomeone telling us we cant have it both ways
10844,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,democrats never get in trouble dont you get it yet
10845,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,what would the charges be
10846,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,another fortune article i’m shocked
10847,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,even the ceos of major crypto exchanges don’t understand how the legal system works
10848,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,paul vernon of cryptsy is not in custody eithergerald cotton  of quadrigacx is mia as welli can do this all daycraig wright craig grant trevon james bitconnect bandits in generalcrypto nick et albrian is likei can flat out steal and get the hell away with itcz is not in jail eitheryetbut i think we are going to live to see that
10849,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the guy is blabbing all on his own as soon as they take him in his lawyers will take over and he won’t say a thing there’s a good chance he’ll spill it all for congressional hearings if he doesn’t get scared off first they’re biding their time he’s not going anywhere
10850,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,not when you consider his friends in high places he is clearly being protected by his political allies
10851,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,c’mon man it’s different for sbf
10852,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,baffling is an understatement check out the declaration by the new ftx ceo on the current fiasconever in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented
10853,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,hes not in custody yet because the political plutocracy feels he did them a favor by washing away the dirty plebs that had the audacity to try to insert laugh built lifechangingwealth
10854,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,what law did he break y’all used to brag there was no regulations on crypto but this exactly why we have regulations on most financial things
10855,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,do kwon and sbf should fight it out for the most hated title
10856,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,im baffled the mother of all scammers goldman sachs llyod blankfein never went to jail or got prosecuted the dude retired a billionaire safe and sound
10857,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,jesus fucking christ  can a lawyer please chime in and tell us wtf is the law on this so everyone can shut the fuck up    my god 
10858,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,so anyway what are the chances that sbf was bought out early by the banks to do exactly what hes done in order to tank crypto and make people go back to fiat and banks
10859,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,meanwhile ross ulbricht is in prison for life for running a website and not stealing any money
10860,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,lol look at all the donations he made to the current administration and the mystery resolves itself the doj is completely compromised which should terrify everyone regardless of affiliation
10861,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s baffling that he hasn’t been restricted from speaking publicly or leaving the country he probably won’t be formally charged with anything until the prosecutors are sure it will stick and not get thrown out sbf will have a legal army who will act to discredit the shit out of anything gotta have everything lined up before coming at him
10862,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he’s basically on a world tour digging himself a deeper hole instead
10863,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,thats how far big democratic donations can bring you good to know ohh and ofc a mother sucking the cock of the democrats leading party
10864,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,democratic ✅jewish ✅vegan ✅altruistic ✅very very sorry ✅he’s too protected and privileged guys move on
10865,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,democrats literally love setting criminals free and happy as long as they fit their agenda or donate enough
10866,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s not baffling if you open yourself up to the possibility that this was entirely orchestrated
10867,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,his mom runs a democratic super pache hacked himself to bribe the bahamians he donates to the people who would investigate him nothing bad will ever happen to him his job was to pave the way for cbdcs he did so well y’all are dumb af if you think he’s being honest nowhe literally said in an interview he lies through his teeth and says whatever needs to be said
10868,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,what is bahamas waiting for loli guess you get what pay for
10869,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he saw this coming and paid off everyone he needed to
10870,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yeah the fact he is still doing interviews really shows how he paid off everyone for immunity from the disaster
10871,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,sbf won’t do a second if jail time his parents ethnoreligious and  political affiliations will make sure of it
10872,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,
10873,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s baffling the gross misconduct then enablementignorance displayed by governments regarding the whole fiasco but to be expected
10874,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,this is how “paying people off” works
10875,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its not baffling if you know the answer
10876,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,being helped by his previous benefactors of his donations
10877,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,money is king as always
10878,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,well when your rich its rules for thee not for me
10879,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yeah i want him locked up
10880,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,why is it baffling crypto is not regulated
10881,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he’s in self custody
10882,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,im not a lawyer but i think this will just turn into a class action lawsuit over time i could also be totally wrong and they may be getting charges properly sorted so they dont mess up when they do arrest him only time will tell
10883,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,hes rich as fuck theres no way hell be arrested soon
10884,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,seems that its easier to get away with multibillion fraud if youre american prove me wrongafter all the evergrande shit and all the fingerpointing its seems that tether issues ftt and most other scams all seem to be centered on the statesis it just that america has so many people invested in crypto and that has attracted all the scammers
10885,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,
10886,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,u and me both buddy  governments looking like a scam right now
10887,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the doj in america doesn’t even try anymore
10888,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,brian armstrong knows his exchange is solvent hence the level of jab taken on sbf
10889,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,baffling is a nice way of putting it
10890,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,are we all
10891,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,we are all baffled
10892,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,hmmm ya know all the rest of us been wonderin bout that too
10893,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,shows the stupidity of the entire crypto space with this insight
10894,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,
10895,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i smell house arrest in mum  pops  milly mansion
10896,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,you distribute  amongst political parties and its not that surprising the same politicians that would lock everyone down but have their own parties and gatherings the ones that would take away your right to defence but are guarded by armed police and guards at their side rules for thee but not for me
10897,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,me too brian me too
10898,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,are people just now understanding that rich people get away with more
10899,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s almost like it was planned…
10900,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,sbf isnt in custody because he donated millions to democrat reelection campaigns  prove me wrong
10901,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,baffling indeed
10902,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i wonder if he thinks its baffling trump has yet to be arrested his crimes go well beyond financial
10903,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he scammed people desperate to be scammed im struggling to see the crime here
10904,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,democrats am i right
10905,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,amazing what being the second biggest donor to the party that controls the justice department will get you
10906,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,corruption is not really baffling when its obvious
10907,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,don’t be deflecting you’re probably next homeboy
10908,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,should just declare martial law and do it ourselves
10909,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its baffling mr armstrong isnt in jail as well for peddling shitcoin and failure of oversight of his own employee for insider trading
10910,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,baffling is not what comes to my mind  i guess ba has to exercise withstraint
10911,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it really does blow my mind but at the same time it just goes to show what money can buy these days crimes turn into fines when you’re rich enough
10912,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,sbf is not in custody because they want someone to bladt him before he squeals
10913,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,do kwon is still at large sbf is on an interview tour but a heroic dev who tried to protect our financial privacy was arrested next day after usa announced sanctions on tornado cashclown world we are living in and not the funny type of clown
10914,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,hee may not be in custody but my coins are in my custody
10915,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i hope we see a do kwon found and locked up or sbf finally jailed headlines soon one can hope
10916,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,step one for sbf get a fucking haircut
10917,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,every broker uses fractional reserve to be clear
10918,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,didnt his lawyers advize him not to talk to mediaby talking he can only screw things up and it drives people mad seeing psychopath lying and acting dumb
10919,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,everyone just needs to read foucault already
10920,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i’m guessing the doj is pretty content to have sbf talk all he wants on tv dude should keep his fucking mouth shut he’s literally doing doj’s work for them
10921,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,sbf is deep state that’s the reason
10922,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i hate when that happens a few billion here a few billion there pretty soon its real money
10923,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its not baffling at all the shit head knew he could go down so he backed politicians with customers funds to ensure he doesnt get raped in jail
10924,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,why do you think people like epstein weinstein and maxwell got away for so long
10925,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the need for competent cfos and cpas has never been greater than for the crypto industry none of the accountants should have allowed this did he even have any
10926,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,well he wasnt caught with  gram of weed which is a much worse crime also he only stole from poor people so its okay no rich andor powerful people were harmed
10927,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he is right on that one
10928,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,to the best of my knowledge that wasnt ftx money but im not sure im fairly surprised that happened
10929,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i notice when i find an extra  in my venmo account
10930,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yeah but he feels so bad about it let’s give him a break
10931,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the situation has become unreal if sbf will get away with this as a society were a joke
10932,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it would confer legitimacy
10933,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i have a feeling this is not gonna age well either
10934,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its crazy how you can escape justice with a deep well thoughtthrough idea wallet
10935,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it seems like bernie madoff was nabbed quickly but maybe im just misremembering the time like from that period
10936,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it truly is
10937,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its weird how big firm accounting errors tend to always favour the firm ive made an accounting error before it screwed me out of money not the other way around
10938,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,coinbase are sketchy too though and should not be trusted
10939,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,seems like the millions in donations can buy you immunity
10940,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,someone gives me millions im not looking into shit either
10941,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,how come nothing like that ever happens to me or anyone i know 
10942,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i cant transfer  without all kinds of paperwork and evidence
10943,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,not baffling  you think feds roll up instantly when a crime has potentially been committed  whats baffling is you all couldnt wait to get into some speculative ponzi scheme that is purposely outside federal regulations and oversight and now you want the feds to step in to figure out the ponzi token thefts because you personally got burned  it might take a minute ok john galt
10944,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,can someone explain to me what the actual crime sbf committed other than failing miserably he didnt walk away with anyones money he lost everything too  just asking
10945,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,do kwan and sbf must have such a backlog of litigation  i’m sure they’re in loads of trouble but a public keel hauling would be helpful for the future
10946,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,serious question for those who are frustrated that sbf hasn’t been charged in the us can the us even charge him with a crime yes he’s a citizen but he operated a bahamian business from the bahamas he committed crimes there people are bringing up reciprocity between the two countries but isn’t that when someone commits a crime in the us then fleas the us i am not a lawyer but won’t sbf have to be charged in the bahamas for his crimes what am i missing that he could be charged in the us for crimes committed by a business he owned and operated in a different country tia for missing piece
10947,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the us government want to use him as an example of how dangerous crypto are but he also donated hundreds of millions to both republicans and democrats thus the incentive for punishment is low since the punishment to the real bad actors aka the evil retail buyer who wants to get out of the bank system is already done
10948,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,him and everyone else
10949,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,assange government spends a decade trying to get himsam bankmanfried no action required
10950,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he paid his fee to the bahamian authorities… duh
10951,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yes it is even more baffling after  no one went to jail no surprise to anyone
10952,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,well if you get the right accountant and lawyer in the room together at the same   whatever you want it to be its really not a joke ive been there have the receipts
10953,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he’s just mad because his company is regulated and has share holders with whom he is accountable
10954,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,no its not the lil fucker is bidens lapdog of course the law wont apply to him
10955,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the error was that it wasnt covered up properly or the laundry was on the wrong setting
10956,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,there are tons of scams and ponzi schemes out there they all seem to have very little risk of getting shut down until they piss off the wrong person
10957,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,rich privilege
10958,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i found  billion under the couch cushions the other day i’m sure he just forgot where he had put it
10959,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the basic difference between a thief and a fraudster  the thief uses a gun and goes to jail a fraudster smiles steals and just walks away his the same criminal with a phd in disguise nothing else
10960,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,just because i’m a cynical bastard i’m gonna wait to see this on ragedlikemilk
10961,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,anybody else would be locked up letting the msm speak for them pays to have gary g on your side
10962,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,crypto isnt regulated by the sec  tough shit to the people ho lost money
10963,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s not really what’s baffling is his lawyers not hitting the exits in record time he’s going to be a difficult client
10964,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,rules dont apply with enough money involved
10965,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,these billions just showed up in a tragic boating accident
10966,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,shiny head
10967,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i often find a couple bill down the back of the sofa myself
10968,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,binance  ftx made tons of money out of futures while coinbase did nothow about explaining coin not introducing futures trading leaving billions on the table mr armstrongis armstrong a credible competent executive or part of an eloquent act altogether with other crooks
10969,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,nothing baffling about a government plant not having consequences for their actions
10970,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,you see when those billions went missing it went to the right people to prevent his arrest corruption can keep you out of prison
10971,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,is that the stonks guy
10972,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,disenfranchised boys go to jail for stealing a tv  he gets applause for stealing billions and putting them into the right pockets
10973,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s because he’s in the bahamas and ftx is a bahamas company
10974,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,flip it around if brian was caught with his pants down would he make this same comment about himself
10975,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,baffling is an understatement check out the declaration by the new ftx ceo on the current fiasconever in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedented
10976,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i would need something strange like this for my  kids right now  unluckily our strange things can be around  rupies only 
10977,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,hmm wonder why maybe look at his donations to political parties
10978,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,was taking xrp off your exchange an accounting error 
10979,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,hmmm baffling… really you’re baffled
10980,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,so if the representatives got stolen money shouldnt they return it to the rightful owners
10981,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,meanwhile ordinary citizens get the hammer when they do similar  
10982,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,stop the nonsense no one gets arrested on federal charges within weeks of the actual event enron took four years from discovery to trialconviction  this isn’t a sixty minute law and order episode
10983,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,im sure does think that  im also sure that he would think it is bullshit he is being arrested if it turned out he was stealing billions from coinbase users these guys are all clowns
10984,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,sbf is a psychotic grifter who deserves the worst but he was right about one thing  he was able to do this the checks that should have been there to stop him weren’t  the laws that should be there to have him in prison already aren’t there  the audits that should have double and triple verified weren’t  the conflicts of interested never investigated  the questions just weren’t askedhe is completely to blame and a shit stain of a person but he really did show the holes in the current system to a shocking degree
10985,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yen yen sbf is wrong on all levels but still doesn’t mean you or coinbase should be trusted you guys have a closed system 
10986,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,seeing as how he donated millions to us political campaigns there is no mystery here atall cash then influence then law then morality in that order
10987,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,baffling what do you think those donations were for
10988,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,when the law doesnt equally apply to everyone bad things arent far off
10989,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its baffling that the fbi doesnt have a field office in the bahamasits baffling that they havent rushed to create an extradition treaty when dealing with the collapse of an unregulated off shore and entityits just simply baffling
10990,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,please say this louder for the people in the back cheers 
10991,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he funded politicians of course he wont be in custody hell he will never be arrested yet people worship these corrupt politicians
10992,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,not saying i disagree but more wondering this myselfif hes guilty and is so simple to understand why hasnt he been arrested or detained has he even been questioned yet
10993,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,people always talk shit about how slow federal investors are to act but isnt thier conviction rate over  this guy screwed institutional investors he is going to prison
10994,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,well it’s not like the us can just grab him why authorities in the bahamas haven’t nailed i’m i have no…come on we all know why
10995,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,his ego is broken period nothing else about this person is broken
10996,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,most people would already by in handcuffs by this point
10997,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s really not when you pay off politicians and the media nothing will ever happen to you
10998,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,someone put him in the pen already so he can start trading soups for safety
10999,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,call it the epstein effect
11000,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it was his son oj protected him sbf is protecting his parents
11001,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,basically hes inviting shareholders to sue him for negligence
11002,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,his next book i didnt steal peoples money but if i did heres how i would have
11003,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,crypto is most definitely offering a show like no other plots and twist around every corner…what a crap show though pathetic is an understatement
11004,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he is not the first one who need to find himself give him time
11005,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,bail
11006,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i bet if his time online playing games was tracked it could show where he was and how much time he didnt attribute to running any companies
11007,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i wonder how many sbf is the best guy in the world articles they were paid for
11008,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,remember when they went on a media tour to justify getting an ambassador killed in benghazi
11009,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,criminally negligent at the very leastbut his knowledge of this mess is so much more than he pretends it to behe and his parents cashed inthey remainin the bahamas if this was donald trump
11010,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,if he would look into a mirror for once he would find the guy responsible
11011,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,that was my immediate hunch dont know why  havent given it much thought
11012,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,chances are they’ll help him enough they won’t get into trouble but then he’s under the bus
11013,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,it’s an absolute mockery of our justice system all americans should be held to the same letter of the law and this has to be the most public corrupt action of our governments law ever it’s a backhanded slap in the face of every single tax paying american
11014,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,if the wallet don’t have money you must acquit cheers 
11015,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,now we just waiting for his book… i didn’t take the money but if i did this is how i did it
11016,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,well he’s currently being coached by the experts at deflection…mainstream media and the democratic party
11017,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he possibly didnt a useful front man for the real actors leaving the children to romp around freely playing video games all day long
11018,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,is this one of the situations where the phrase ur mama might be factually correct
11019,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,investigate his and his familys tenacles in this pandemic with john hopkinsvery interesting
11020,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,same energy as jack disowning involvement in election fiddling
11021,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,failing is one thing he didn’t fail at running the exchange he took the money from the exchange because his investments failed that’s fraud
11022,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,wasnt vice also one of the wokeleft media that sbf splurged his other peoples money on
11023,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,dont worry sbf the dems and reps will help you get out of this pickle
11024,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,usually fraudsters don’t go on media tours until after coming out of the clink and writing a book something very odd about this campaign does he not have lawyers
11025,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,she’s been before the house ethics committee before she knows what to say
11026,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,imagine how much effort every one huffing and puffing here invested in pretending not to get the joke
11027,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,reminds me of the time when i was a kid and my mother came home early to find the cigarettes and beer that my friends and i were enjoying i told her that i didnt know where they came from maybe somebody broke in for some reason she didnt believe the story
11028,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,my simple rule would have saved people money never trust anyone with hyphenated last names i learned that the hard way when maurice jonesdrew cost me the fantasy football championship
11029,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,thats actually pretty obvious when you look at and listen to the guy he was clearly a front man who will now be thrown under the bus when elon tweeted about microservices it was an obvious to me key to what was happening behind the scenes with the alameda and ftx contractors
11030,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the real killer was ojs son look into it thats why he took the wrap
11031,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he stole billions by co mingling funds thats criminal and he should be forced to sell everything and do time 
11032,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he had a very small team one in the bahamas was about  people if i remember correctly if that is true how long does it take to find the culprit among  people unless he is the culprit which i believe he is
11033,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,lol it’s like me when i hit a guardrail i blamed it on a deer there was no deer
11034,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,bro the fact that he still hadn’t been found is killing me
11035,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he fed the dem machine a ton of money he’s their boy no touchy
11036,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,because the money went to the dems
11037,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he’s giving daily interviews to paint a less incriminating view of himself
11038,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he allegedly facilitated a bunch of backchanneling of taxpayer dollars  and allegedly contributed bribed to the current us political party in office he undoubtedly has some political and business connections who are able to assist him through their personal networkhe should be in custody but im unsurprised that he isnt
11039,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the new york times audience applauded him let that sink in wtf
11040,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,his freedom is a byproduct of being a member of americas preferred class a child of highly educated coastal elite professorsmanagement class who act as the invisible hand of both parties his freedom is a choice by the us gov who could easily press the bahamian gov for extradition
11041,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i mean its an imaginary coin with no value that people threw money into if he wrote the tos well i can see why theres hesitancy about what to charge him with and which agency from what country is responsible
11042,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,its almost like lots of money and government connections allows you to commit crimes or something
11043,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,yea fr
11044,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,thats what ive been saying

11047,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,we’re all thinking the same thing brian all thinking the same thing…
11048,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,
11049,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he is in custody with my funds

11057,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,trying to push a little too much lol like how those that are guilty push for harsher punishments for others that get caught in order to prove theyre not guilty themselves
11058,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,give sbf the electric chair
11059,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i hope coinbase affairs are all in order else someone would be saying same to him
11060,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,i mean even people on the buttcoin sub agree with him
11061,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,he should be happy in case he find himself in the same situation
11062,zbtuvz,2022-12-03 23:16:56,the death of one is a tragedy the death of millions is just a statistic
11901,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here from compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals this situation is unprecedentedfull quote holy shit that is damning
11902,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,headquartering a major fintech  in the bahamas in a penthouse should have been a warning it was a ponzi tho…
11903,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,all this information might be shocking but it explains the sudden collapse very well all these frauds were like a house of cards and it collapsed near instantlyits kinda scary the amount of shit ftx was able to pull with their customers money till now
11904,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,don’t worry folks he said sorry and that he wants to make customers whole s
11905,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is actually incredible ftx loans alameda money alameda then gives sbf money and this is all users funds lmao
11906,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the new ceo of ftx who oversaw the bankruptcy of enron said this regarding sbf’s management never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial informationif the guy who oversaw enron’s bankruptcy is this baffled…
11907,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,jesus christ this i did not expect this is way beyond the mismanagement i thought was happening
11908,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the speed with which this guy has pulled together all of this information and got to grips with what went wrong is actually superimpressive
11909,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,
11910,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you telling me a group of greedy drug enthusiasts  years olds cant run a billion dollar company
11911,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,all that while he was printing ftt from thin air
11912,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the debtors did not have the type of disbursement controls that i believeare appropriate for a business enterprise for example employees of the ftx group submitted payment requests through an online ‘chat’ platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojis
11913,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,he also said he was faking all of his ethics i mean we caught on it but saying it himself makes it  more sinister
11914,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and this smarmy asshole was meeting with elected officials to draft legislation to dictate all of crypto in the us
11915,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,waiting on the documentary
11916,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the new ceo is significantly more brutal than mainstream media  lol  🤡🌎
11917,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,from section d  paragraph idk what its calledat this time the debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the ftx group as of the petition date or the terms of their employmentdude come the fuck on they cant even fucking tell who actually worked at the company
11918,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this speaks volumes to what kevin o’leary’s actual iq is
11919,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i stand by my statement i tell everyone it was embezzled
11920,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,real estate and items for employees wtf even worse than i thought how scam bankrunfraud handled the assets
11921,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, never in my career have i seen such a complete failure of corporate control   remember this is the guy who handled the enron collapse
11922,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,that clown deserves to spend rest of his life in jail along with his creature of girlfriend fucking psychos
11923,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so essentially they treated investors funds as their own piggy bank a total ponzi scheme
11924,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the guy overseed the enron fiasco and its out here saying ftx is far worse not in our wildest dreams can we imagine how badly sbf and alameda fcked things up
11925,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,after this mess i decided to buy my hardware wallet and move my main investment therei’ll lose some interest but damn… these are criminals
11926,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and yet this sociopath was able to captivate the entire mediasphere masquerading as some golden boy genius you cant trust shit out there
11927,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,ftx says the fair value of all the crypto non stablecoins that ftx international holds is a mere  personal note they do have  bill in stabledisregarding the stablecoins even my moons are now worth more than ftx
11928,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol sbf just straight up stole billions of dollars

11932,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,no wonder sbf now says he regrets filing for bankruptcy  they hired the perfect guy to investigate his mess and set him up for prosecution it appears
11933,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,interesting how everyone here is now all like “hah what did you expect these are  yo people” but none of these voices were here  months ago stop pretending you were any more wise than anyone else here no one that was not in on this knew what was going on and that includes all of us here
11934,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i really hope there wont be a do kwon part  this egomaniac fool before he decides to start running

11945,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this should haunt sam for rest of his life
11946,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,netflix can’t handle these many documentaries in just a year
11947,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,how is he still a free man
11948,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i don’t sbf think had any intentions to actually make this company or himself profitable

11952,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,because none of this is regulated… he will walk couple “securities” fraud charges as sec rushes to regulate his lawyersparents will poke holes through it watch
11953,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the real question is will sbf escape to a nonextradition country before the bahamas deports him to the us
11954,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,thats how much you need to live a simple life and drive a corolla
11955,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,sorry guys all these exchanges screwed us if you have coins on exchanges there’s a high chance they’re just digits on a screen if i were you i’d remove them now before they’re all gone every exchange is most likely trading insolvent
11956,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,they were also for sure manipulating prices there was not one time i didn‘t buy either the top or bottom with  on ftx almost instantly after buying price went against me and activated stop loss and i tried with  trades these bastards scammed their customers
11957,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is why companies have nonexecutive directors this isn’t a crypto story it’s a corporate governance one
11958,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,he owns  of the hedge fund  thats a loan from himself to himself  with user funds
11959,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,did he use any of that money to buy shampoo for himself or his girlfriend
11960,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so wheres the money sam
11961,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,wild they could make one more season of silicone valley based out of this stuff just changing the peoples and corporations names
11962,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,
11963,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,holy shit you couldnt even make this up for a move it would be to insane
11964,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,it would be nice to see those whom received campaign contributions return the money to the customers
11965,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and still people blame it on cz for its collapse imagine if this keeps on going for another year
11966,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so i routinely get told by some younger co workers how great crypto is and how its going to make them richhmmm to all of you never forget this statementnot all that glitters is gold
11967,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you mean his customers provided him with a  billion loan
11968,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you haven’t  take a look at the world in general lol greed is destroying this planet
11969,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,what a dumpster fire
11970,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, is way closer to  than it is to whatever the fuck they owe like  commas are missing here
11971,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so apropos “she was eating an apple so i ate one too” much like the fall of civilization let’s blame the implosion of  on the woman
11972,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,just imagine the fallout we dont know yet this isn’t the only large crypto group acting shady this is the beginning of the crypto crashrebirth like the dot com bubble  years ago
11973,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if these companies had just operated and ran like they said they were sbf is easily a fkn billionairebut this is what gets methatwasntenoughlike tf manim having trouble wrapping my head around thatall that money just wasnt enough he had to borrow and loan and cheat and just be a fkn awful awful human beinglike dudejust do it right i cant fathom the minds of people like this do qwon sbftheres a fkn list of people that had millions and billions if theyd just showed up and done what they saidughthese people need hurt
11974,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,where did he put that money in again back into ftt to pump it up
11975,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,nobody wants to watch that and i dont believe sbf would have enough gumption to even want to have intimate relations with her anyway
11976,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,thats what sam deserve after what he did to his exchange users
11977,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and the fucker still walks free
11978,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,that sex tape though

11980,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,what a complete clusterfuck
11981,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is really a shitshow very disgraceful
11982,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,sbf needs too be given the same if not more ‘football numbers’ in terms of jail time the same way ross ulbrichtdpr got done by the government
11983,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,crypto needed this reckoning i’ve watched some real great insight and opinions flow this site and sub over the years but i’ve also seen some absolutely moronic bullshit get upvoted to the toptrusting individuals with unimaginable amounts of capital and no oversight pretty much never works out and the returns promised in the mess are always an absolute redflag i don’t know why so many people not in this sub in particular just in general thought this company was the exceptionit sucks that so many average retail investors are gonna lose real money here but it’s an expensive lesson lack of oversight and promises and riches are a scam… doesn’t matter if this coming from the mom next door selling you on here essential oils “business” or some mit grad taking money and hiding it in the bahamas
11984,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the wheels of the ftx bus just went thump thump thump over the prone body of its former driver
11985,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if i could ever envision what the face of a fart would look like that would be it
11986,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,anyone seen the larry david comercial where he rejects ftx and it says dont be like larryi guess larry was right and people should of been more like him
11987,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,they were doing freebies with hard earned investors money very senseless
11988,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this rabbit hole is filled with shitmarkets are so fucked up  a group of booger eating kids duped so many
11989,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,sbf still trying to justify himself theres this  he gave in his twitter dms he thought the reporter wouldnt leak it or something hes a complete scumbag and basically justify it by saying everyone is in finance 🤷
11990,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so who says any of the others are any better  we have seen so many fuck ups this year why should the others be by any better crypto has become a atm for scammers
11991,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,havent you seen how some crypto geeks praised the ceo for even sleeping on the job red flag the length of the globe to me people say we cant judge by appearances but i would never trust this one man just by seeing him
11992,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,let me guess theyll settle out of court for an undisclosed sum noone will ever get their money back no criminal charges will be filed as long as doj gets a fruit basket 😉😉 noone will admit wrongdoing and well all just keep trundling along in the hellscape weve made for ourselves
11993,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,my goodness i literally opened and closed an account within two days because it just didnt feel right glad i listened to my gut
11994,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,she loss money sam was doing as always giving her money to retry
11995,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,he never saw things like this because usually who do things like this is a thief ready to be on a run and hide any track of moneysbf lives on total different reality he is not a thief because he thinks that in crypto he even can decide what is a thief or not he even said that he needs help for the bankruptcy process of the company first thing they do is remove him for that processand the conclusion of that is one of the most ridiculous delivering of documentation for a bankruptcy
11996,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i get that novel ideas tend to have rocky starts as they find their place in the world but reading this after hearing about all the crazy hype of crypto being the future as a means to escape corrupt government  regulation of money is really off putting something tells me crypto isnt going to be a huge hype party in the future
11997,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,yet they can’t explain how he even managed to get that loan…
11998,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,nice he will prob trade the  billion into  billion by the end of the day problem solved at  leveraged he barely even needs the market to go up
11999,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,it must’ve been her sparkling personality brilliant mind and loving heart that captivated him
12000,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,“never in my career have as seen such a complete failure of corporate controls” they must have never met ken griffin
12001,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,what kind of person needs a  personal loan no board no due diligence no accounting etc its worse than bernie madoff it was a koolaid party everyone was drinking it
12002,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,and at the end of it all  nobody will be held accountable the money will remain ”missing” and people will make the same mistake again with the next boy or girl wonder that gets lucky      elizabeth holmes gets sentenced later today  a woman that lied to investors actually gave instructions to provide people who trusted theranos inaccurate test results which led to who knows how many faulty medical diagnosis  she will probably get the  months of house arrest and not the  to  years in prison she deserves  sorry for the rant
12003,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol and sbf in an interview says nishad is super affected and hurt by this yeah if i lent myself half a billion from the company i was supposed to be running and it collapsed id be affected too
12004,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the asmr will probably sound like a chihuahua locked in a bathroom
12005,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,who the hell wanna see thatnow if it was gary genslers thats would be a huge scandal
12006,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,tornado cash dude is in jail sbf is still free what a fucking joke
12007,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,crypto will take years to recover from this damn
12008,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,did i read it correct 
12009,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,its a deep state plot thats why nothing will happen to him
12010,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,but the nyt said he’s a good guy you mean the media lied no freaking way
12011,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, god damn this is literally a joke

12019,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the debtors did not have the type of disbursement controls that i believe are appropriate for a business enterprise for example employees of the ftx group submitted payment requests through an online chat platform where a disparate group of supervisors approved disbursements by responding with personalized emojishaha i love that
12020,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,yes hello police crypto exchange ceos be wildin
12021,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,whos going to play sbf in the movie about this catastrophe 
12022,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol this shit was a ponzi fuck sam and everyone involved
12023,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the this will be used as an excuse to regulate crypto further and bring in the government controlled digital currency almost like it was all planned from the beginning…
12024,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the worst failure of your career so far
12025,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i wouldn’t even call it a corporation more like a bunch of orgy loving friends… it was a  century scam you have been robbed
12026,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the funniest part of all this is sbf is supposedly still firing out texts trying to raise  to save ftx a company he got booted from for frauding his entire customer base and pilfering billions and hes still messaging people like jack dorsey like hey could i have  minutes of your timebro this thing is more cooked than that pizza you put in the oven before passing out
12027,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,lol im so glad i got out when btc was in the  range i already got burned once with mtgox pleased to hold no positions currently and watch this dumpster fire
12028,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,there was no failure it was a brilliantly organized rug pull
12029,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,oh wow i think this can get upgraded from netflix to hbo now
12030,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, nice as a former user your check for  is on the way
12031,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,but he drives an old beat up toyota
12032,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,we know that the question is where did it all go
12033,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,thats crazy how can someone run a business like this put him in jail
12034,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,scam bankrunfraud
12035,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,ftx investors should take some of the blame they were suppose to be the adults in the room bringing decades of experience knowing pragmatic accounting practices for examplebut similar to the bernie madoff situation investors got greedy they didn’t look do due diligence but carried on like it’s a home runsbf takes a good chunk of the blame for sure but let’s not concentrate the blame to one or  people when the company its board it’s investors should have known  done better
12036,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,just absolute pure greed nothing else to it the guy just kept wanting more and stole customers funds to fuel whatever obsession he had the dude and everyone else involved need to go to jail for a long time
12037,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,holy shit is really is the new enroncant wait to watch the cold fusion video on this
12038,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,so he said enron was a shit show but  ftx   is a latrine porta potty  extravaganza
12039,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,imagine losing hundreds of thousands or millions to this clown show and you have to start from zero that would drive me insane
12040,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,sbf learned from gerald cotten just didnt learn how to disappearfake your death
12041,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,they don’t have an accounting department are you actually kidding me that’s beyond belief an organisation that size should have hundreds of finance staff with countless qualified accountants this beggars belief
12042,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i outtraded alameda this cycle confirmed holy shit
12043,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,that  was  squid bought at the top
12044,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,whats really wild is any of the existing exchanges could also be doing this so many warning threads here are dismissed as fud because well the company said theyre solvent and have  asset liability matching  of course they say that and anyway whats wrong with fud theres a lot of uncertainty and doubt right now with good reason you should be afraidthere is no oversight no sox no trustworthy independent third party audits this is what people build when you try to build a trustless financial system stuff that cannot be trustedtheres no hard evidence that theyre stealing or making negligent loans to each other fairbut there is evidence they are passing around coins to disclose their assets nb no liability disclosure which makes asset disclosure worthless anyway hmmm there is evidence that there are a lot more bad loans in the crypto system and there is precedent for straight up making shit up and providing faketoken assurances to cover your ass in times of distress
12045,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,when will sbf be in jail
12046,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,oh yes  vs just  lol lets be honest with the amount lost realistically there is zero difference between  and  lol
12047,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is what you get when you let a “bro” run a financial institute
12048,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,how has sbf not been arrested yet
12049,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
12050,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,new ceo is there even a company left to run
12051,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you know what safeguards against this kind of corruption  strong regulations
12052,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,y’all gave money to this loser he looks like a greasy leftover hamburger helper
12053,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,alruist with a  loan
12054,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,this is what happens when you leave the children unsupervised
12055,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if only we had some sort of regulations
12056,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,yeah i’ll protect her if she wants me to she can hide out with me in a small midwest town
12057,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,if they are not going to jail then i will
12058,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,we all know this was a scam now but im sorry what  ftx group did not maintain centralized control of its cash cash management procedural failures included the absence of an accurate list of bank accountsnot to mention the debtors have been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked for the ftx group as of the petition date or the terms of their employment repeated attempts to locate certain presumed employees to confirm their status have been unsuccessful to date how do you not have a list of bank accounts and employees

12065,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,the biggest problem with crypto right now is exchanges and how they run they take peoples crypto buy orders but never actually buy on the blockchain and move actual assets which hinders the true price value on cryptothen theres also the problem of us literally centralizing our crypto holdings on a non centralized crypto
12066,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,im not following this too closely so im certainly missing something but where or who are these clientsftx i thought would have some semblance of a retail presence with custody of crypto bro   and  assets that are now lockedgone where are these bros with their pitchforks in all these threads am i just  not seeing themor was it all institutional money pensions and vcs will write down and move on blockfi already facing reality how many others are therejust weird thats a shit ton of liabilities to not have joe retail causing a hell of a ruckus online

12072,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,what could go wrong with getting a person loan from anybody for a billion dollarsone would think that even the most brazen sociopath would stop for minute and think about the potential consequences that always go along with borrowing a billion dollars
12073,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i feel like theres going to be a lot more jaw dropping moments in the months to come
12074,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43, related party loans receivable of  billion at alameda research consolidated consisted primarily of a loan by euclid way ltd to paper bird inc a debtor of  billion and three loans by alameda research ltd one to mr bankmanfried of  billion one to mr singh of  million and one to ryan salame of  millionlol this guy redirects customers cash through shell corporations to lend to his own company who then lends it straight to him   lock him the fuck up already  sick of seeing him act like he hasnt stolen everyones money and it was just an unfortunate snafu   this company was rotten to the coreya know its a shitshow when the new ceo literally has to preface all data he presents with a disclaimer about its likely inaccuracyhowever because this balance sheet was unaudited and produced while the debtors were controlled by mr bankmanfried i do not have confidence in it and the information therein may not be correct as of the date stated

12081,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,chamath palihapitiya a senior executive at facebook from  to  discusses ftx the interview is great and he talks about how ftx told his vc group f off when they did their due diligence and gave them strict accounting and board requirements on investments i found it very insightful  
12082,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,i mean the dude started off by buying btc in american markets for  then turning around and selling it in the japanesemarkets for  idk exactly what is wrong with that but i saw an interview with him when he said that and i immediately thought to myself “that’s not something i would be so willingly open to admit”
12083,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,now do tether
12084,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,how did real hedge funds that got involved with ftx not see that it was shady wouldnt the lack of proper accounting be obvious to a sophisticated investor doing proper dd

12094,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,you know the ones saying no are going to be the ones looking for it and watching it over and over
12095,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,it’s like some ppl choose to forget things i have no doubt ppl will flock back to ftx despite getting fucked over them before bc they’re under new management… they’re all the same guys every centralized exchange acts like a bank with no fdic insurance on a much more volatile asset than the usd keep your own keys jesus i feel like some ppl like getting fucked over
12096,yxq8s2,2022-11-17 13:27:43,definitely watch this if you never want to get hard again
12489,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,bitcoin    and related info are in the collapsed comments below pros and cons will change for every new post
12490,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,sbf just gave them the justification they have been waiting for the regulations will be far reaching and beyond centralized crypto exchanges sbf is such a douche i hope they put him in prison forever
12491,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,afaik this is quite a nothingburger of a story its bullets  and  from the  report at  they specifically refer to stable coins in  and in general want to be able to share asset information for pursuing tax avoiders theres probably more to it but i was expecting something more tangible rather than ambiguous we think well do something
12492,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,it’s not crypto that’s at fault it’s the exchanges that need regulation
12493,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,regulation of crypto exchanges to protect users is eminently reasonable but we also need protection from overreaching regulations that want to protect users from crypto
12494,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,just dont let people like sbf have cex
12495,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,one crypto exchange goes belly up and we need new rules but when every major bank fs up global economy every decade or so they get a lil slap on the wrist
12496,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the problem is with exchanges and fractional lending not btc and crypto
12497,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,what sbf did is illegal in almost any sector it’s fraudulent and definitely prosecutable crime is crime and this will probably be less about compliance and more about government control in being able to control the lever space is already relatively regulated in the us as evident of all the airdrops i didn’t get as a result of having some tokens in an exchange  when the government still hasn’t resolved poker’s black friday i doubt crypto will become any more favourable as an outcome for the users ironic this generally comes only after the largest institutions made out like robbers and thieves wall street and their quants were behind most of the largest defi drains but this regulation won’t hinder them from operating in the space this regulation is for protecting those with the resources and won’t be in favouring the general public if our officials really cared they would just enforce the already ignored corruption and fraud rather than creating more cases for resource rich organisations to exploit loopholes that those with economic disparities cannot corporate pluralism yall
12498,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,getting a bunch of senile octogenarians to write some gibberish legislation about something they dont understand should fix all the problems
12499,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,regulate centralized exchanges
12500,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,please let them asap a mature market around the corner finally bitcoin and litecoin are commodities not securities they don’t pass the howey test
12501,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,nah hard pass  would rather have the dangers of the rug pulls than to have the useless waste that are governments putting their hands further into peoples pockets and lives
12502,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,almost like he was waiting til trust in the crypto market was down then in comes the democrats to save the day yet again
12503,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,fucking joe biden is just being so fucking clown right now man that shit is always fucking laughable to me and nothing else right now and we can say that
12504,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,crypto will never hit mass adoption without regulation this is a hard but true fact too many big name melt downs too many times causes a massive trust issue and regulations rebuild trust that there is some kind of rules that must be followed to keep charlatans from running the game
12505,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,sorry is this an issue with crypto or the fact that us regulatory bodies allowed ftx to commit fraudulent activities on a huge scale its like saying we need to regulate eggs because the farmers were breaking all of them
12506,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,very likely decentralisation of currency thats a nogo fosho
12507,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i wonder if he pronounces it cripetoe off the teleprompter repeat the line
12508,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,if the existing laws here in the us were applied to ftx it wouldnt have happened  more laws will not fix this and they know that  they just want to edge out the competition for cbdcs  i have yet to see a regulation the government wont abuse
12509,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the big guy they lost all our money so now is the time to reform crypto  let us invest first then we will pass the bill
12510,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
12511,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,doesn’t regulation prevent what crypto set out to achieve in the first place
12512,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden is being stupid and thats all i can sense right now and that is the fucking reality right now man we all know why we are saying shits like that right now
12513,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,give back the stolen money sbf gave you joe that would be game changing
12514,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,we need regulation but not big brother controlling everything needs to ride a fine line to protect the user while not controlling them
12515,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,theyre simply feasting on the ftx collapse using it as a piggybackride for imposing regulation across the space sad to read really
12516,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,they planned this from the beginning
12517,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,what about setting rules on printing money
12518,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this shit of ftx looks almost staged like exactly what they were looking for
12519,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the same problems would not have occurred in the mainstream financial systembullshitenron bear stearns lehman etcalso ftx built an analogue of the traditional financial system and that is why this happenedpeople see crypto companies and think that means literal cryptoregulate exchanges that hold coins  meaning the crypto industry banksftx advertised as crypto while being basically a bahamas based bank doing fraud with customer fundsdexes fix this but regulation will probably make dexes incredibly hard to create thus simply putting crypto into the identical system with regulatory capture
12520,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,just dont fuck it up biden
12521,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,régulation will benefit the rich i bet my entire crypto portfolio

12535,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,centralized exchanges need transparency tough audits and tight regulations not individuals who choose selfcustody furthermore we as an industry need to lead with standards and best practices for token deployments and underlying features built for defi applications
12536,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,he had no idea what he was saying old decrepit twat
12537,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,did he talk about how millions got donated to the democratic party thats stolen money
12538,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,biden doesnt even know what planet hes on he thinks bitcoin is something that happens when you eat a penny
12539,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,there you go right on cue ftx the black swan event to control cryptos with regulations and usher in cbdcsstart using cash everyone cash is king
12540,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,good luck on that one he can regulate centralized exchanges  how is he going to regulate decentralized crypto
12541,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,all of this feels quite orchestrated the corruption in government is quite staggering
12542,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i am just good with the fact that joe biden is an idiot and we can say that shit most of the time most of the time all the fucking time excuse me for being too much
12543,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden is just being joe biden at this point of time and i really dont know what should i say to this bitch he need to stop being like this all the time man
12544,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,thanks sbf now please disappear you and that gollum of caroline
12545,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,theyre all part of the same team they got rich with ftx they will also rule crypto thanks to the same ftxthis was planned
12546,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,im really glad that the regulators sanctioned tornado cash cozied up to sbf and focused on killing defi instead of putting in guardrails to potentially prevent the ftx collapse i feel very protected as an investor right now
12547,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,
12548,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,what a surprise did his party give back the donations yet
12549,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,he cant even add  understanding crypto its an infinite impossibility for joey boy
12550,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,they will just try to kill any alternatives to their cbdcs it is not about consumer protection
12551,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,biden is the last person i want leading the effort for crypto regulations he can barely read a teleprompter let alone understand cryptography and blockchain technology
12552,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,as someone who has been in the crypto space since  good sensible regulation of the space has been needed for years im tired of cowboys like sbf coming in and fucking the crypto space up and ripping people off if the space wants to grow and the general public to have the confidence to jump into the space then there needs to be regulations and safeguards
12553,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,they stole the money and now using their own theft to accomplish their goalits their mo for everything
12554,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,ftx collapse was a false flag to make npc’s thirst for “crypto” bitcoin regulation
12555,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,make your party give the money back joe
12556,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this is the last guy i want regulating crypto… yikes
12557,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,funny how sbf was his second biggest donor…
12558,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,if biden is in favor of crypto regulation then the republicans will be against regulation  if biden is against regulation republicans will be in favor of regulationrepublicans reclaimed the house of representatives so any law coming from bidens side will be blocked  no crypto regulations for now  this is my belief
12559,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,democrats are corrupt in other news water is wet
12560,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,biden is an idiot
12561,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,he can start by telling his fellow politicians to give back those donations
12562,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,wild how it collapsed riiiiight after the mid terms all that donor money spent
12563,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,having geriatric members of congress attempt to regulate a decade old technology is not going to end well especially when these geriatric members of congress have spent triple the amount of time crypto has even existed in gaming the current system that pissed off satoshi so much that an entire currency was created in the fall out of said geriatric politicians regulating mistakes
12564,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,methinks dems knew it was a ponzi to use as a piggy bank knowing it would collapse and they would come in and over regulate the space
12565,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,that guy joe biden is a douche canoe no offense
12566,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,
12567,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,first of all if you think biden even knows what day it is youre out of your mind if you think he knows what crypto is
12568,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden doesnt lead anything  all on purpose and his party is responsible

12570,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,from what ive been listening from gensler they will probably enforce the rules where every altcointoken with icospremines will be deemed as securities better sell all those coins
12571,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,of course  this was all planned… he a a total fraud  gave access to ftx and routed us tax dollars to ukraine who donated back to politicians and now wants to posture like he’s bullet proof  what a bunch of bullshit
12572,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,what if cex are no longer allowed to withdraw crypto to noncustodial wallets
12573,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the only regulation they need is for cexs to hold what their customers own
12574,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,thank god government is there to save me from making my own decisions and facing the consequences of those decisions
12575,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden doesnt even know what crypto is now hes an expert
12576,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,how about firing the head of sec who purposely looked the other way due to their personal connections with him that’d be a start
12577,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this headline is misleading biden doesnt call for anything he just reads whats on the piece of paper in front of him
12578,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the future of crypto will be divided into two one for compliant regulated chains where theres no chance to make money and when you do you get taxed to death and the other will be maximum privacy and unlimited opportunity that will be free from government regulation
12579,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,anyone who did even a few minutes of dd figured out ftx was a ponzi scheme biden and his ilk only care now because it affected them
12580,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,leads is a bit disingenuous
12581,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,how is this helping for companies in the bahamas
12582,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,ive a much beloved relative who keeps losing enormous amounts of money to crypto yet keeps investing because itll balance out soon
12583,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,imagine my shock
12584,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,actually reassuring that he’s in charge of it would’ve been concerned if it was someone competent enough to make waves
12585,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this is small because of the ftx they situation they created
12586,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,never let a crisis go to wasteespecially one you had a major part in creating
12587,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,yeah  we want our crypto to be like our banks…no corruption  🤔
12588,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the stock market is just as fucked up the fed doesn’t care about what happened they care about control
12589,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,seriously though what good are us regulations if the usd is going to lose reserve status anyway the country can never pay off its debt and more rate hikes just bleeding higher interest payments meaning the irs tax dollar is even less effective at actually producing some value for the government this is one of those cases where i think the majority of us here have more time to wait this out than the us does with its power
12590,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,problemcontrolled reactionsolutionsounds familiar how to bring out a govt controlled bitcoin how to crash faith in bitcoin just let the banks control it
12591,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,tougher regulations hmm i mean maybe the sec needs to get their heads out of the dirt and be clear on what coins or what type of tokens are securities rather than being purposefully vague
12592,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i knew this was gonna be the usa governments next move we all just lost
12593,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,do not comply unite fight
12594,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,how convenient the old guard is trying to take control of the new guard lol good luck tik tok
12595,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,anyone who was shocked by the ftx collapse hasn’t been watching crypto for very long
12596,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,may sbf rot in jail he destroyed my life
12597,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,they want your money folks not their money but your money keep voting them into office

12600,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,crypto lives in context the us will be lucky to pass a budget over the next  years  i don’t see any far reaching policy being created on any front let alone crypto
12601,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,totally unpublishable comments on my behalf totally
12602,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,it’s all part of the plan
12603,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,it would be funny if we gave some amphetamine addicted teenagers from bahamas a free card so they can  crash the markets for us🤡
12604,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this is a wakeup call rather than just a bump in the road or the even the end of the road howeverbellavitis expects the bitcoin and crypto industry to eventually recover from the ftx meltdown more regulation  clearer rules will only strengthen what this industry can do
12605,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,nothing will happen that’s joe’s second biggest donor
12606,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12, crypto bros “crypto is the pure expression of the market keep your regulations out of it” crypto bros “ waaaaah i lost my life savings why won’t the gubmint do something waaaaah”

12611,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,theyre just scrambling for damage control after the campaign money laundering scheme fell apart
12612,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,almost seems like it was all planned 🤔

12618,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i hope as lot of politicians lost money
12619,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,we need protection from this pos
12620,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,crypto needs regulation i don’t see a problemabsolute decentralization is a fairy tale doesn’t exist
12621,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,people seem to forget america does not own crypto people buy it to get away from creeps like this and their rotten to the core establishments
12622,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,so many buzzwords all at once lol
12623,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,that people think the govt had to be in cahootz with sbf in order to pass regulation just totally ignoring the last  times this has happened in the past year just lol some of the yall have actual worms in your brains
12624,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,no surprise whatsoever this was all planned and part of the show
12625,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,oh great big brother wants regulationsanybody surprised
12626,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,lets make btc a currency and stop the double taxation
12627,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,ftxs money  to the big guy  global crypto licencing fees  to the big guy
12628,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i think sbf was an inside job  that twat worked for us government
12629,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,ftx was planned as a major hit against crypto and decentralization they however didnt take into account that we now have personal ledgers 
12630,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the problem is we have a bunch of people who do not understand crypto who will try to regulate it but i guess not much different than now how we have people who dont understand economics regulating our money and the stock market
12631,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,sbf has played the part he was meant to play perfectly don’t make the mistake of thinking sbf “just messed up” he was handpicked to take a massive dump on all things defi
12632,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,and thus their plans are working like the wanted the connection between biden administration and ftx leaders are still being uncovered and we’re already changing plans let’s see how they plan to make a decentralized idea to become centralized
12633,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,now all this ftx and sbf stuff all seems like the greater workings of people way starter that were in control major collapse of a exchange and the perfect time for the feds to start taking crypto more seriously with regulations while also preparing to launch their cbdcs let’s find a conspiracy here
12634,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,well how yall biden voters feel now thanks for all of this reallywait till the tether bombshell its coming and its very very uglyedit yo who the fuck voted for this guy  million of you who what a total scam
12635,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden could completely ban crypto across the board and a decent portion of you would still verbally suck his old demented dick
12636,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,bitcoin cannot be regulated
12637,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,anyone who doesn’t think sbf is a fed at this point needs to look back at all his connections his parents caroline’s parents connection to gensler i’ll stop so  you can go down the rabbit hole if interested the fluff articles being published is also a dead give away this all seemed programmed
12638,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,get vatalik and old hosky on the phone

12641,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,first change the sec that does nothing wrt to any form of oversight forget crypto first fix our completely opaque financial reporting system and sro’s our financial markets are run where a financial institutions have to disclose long positions ie bets on the economy but have no disclosure into betting against the economy on the short side the same folks perverted crypto sbf and ftx were being paraded for a reason they bought sbf
12642,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,who the fuck is listening to joe biden over crypto currency i am just fucking laughing to that shit right now because that shit is fucking funny to me right now

12648,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,will boe jiden also cover how sbf and ftx donated his campaign a shit ton of moneys
12649,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,and there it is folks the planned collapse of ftx has reached its goal an excuse for the government to have a reason to try and ruin crypto lets see how many are dumb enough to think it wasnt planned
12650,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,ftx was a false flag to bring about this regulationfiat money fears crypto
12651,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe needs a nap
12652,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the only place joe is leading anyone to is the bathroom to wipe his old wrinkled ass it’s the banks leading the way
12653,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,grampa needs to go take a nap
12654,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,something stinks at how fast this all landed this way
12655,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the sector is huge financially but has very limited regulation the same problems would not have occurred in the mainstream financial systemi peg your pardon
12656,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,what is brandon’s connection with sammy and how much was donated to the dems and biden
12657,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,biden can start by returning to the victims the proceeds of crime that sbf donated to him
12658,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,so they will regulate it about as good as they regulate stocks right
12659,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,off course first create the problem then come with a solution why not first look into the democrats laundre connection into ftx 
12660,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,“trust us we know what’s good for you”   year old politicians to everyone  and younger they’re the ones who were the grandparents who were  and didn’t knowunderstand how to use the internet or a computer and called their kidsgrandkids to help them now they supposedly know how to handle regulate new technology they don’t understand smh
12661,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the best of the best will always use monero back in like  everyone was like lookout bitcoin is gonna get regulated but they couldnt do it do a literal surveillance coin back then let alone do it to monero but now this ftx dick goes on bloomberg letting in the gme i watched it crowed in all planned from the start to be the new crypto exchange just another mt gox but this time planned to bring in the regulation they think they can do while also rolling out their coin if a smart young programmer has a passion for cryptography and freedom what coin do you think they will pick to work on not only work on but do it anonymously for fucking free because they know it is helping the og cypherpunk manifesto and helping humanity or go work on a shitcoin that doesnt do anyhting but what others do that takes zero new knowledge this shit works its self out in the end welcome to my high talk
12662,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,its time for this guy to go  he is a threat to democracy  he is a threat to world peace  he is a racist  he is unprepared  he is stupid  he is partisan and he is selfish  he does not represent the people and he must go
12663,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,will he and democrats give the money they accepted back to the investors that got rug pulled doubt it  fuck ‘em
12664,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,is he going to return his campaign donation he received from ftx customers money
12665,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the plan is rolling at full speed next the vaccination passport and all that crap that we know will come
12666,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,ok now this result plus sbfs dem connections make me think more and more that the ftx fiasco was planned to justify crazy regulations
12667,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,fuck brandon anyway
12668,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,even if regulation takes place it shouldn’t be implemented by dinosaurs like biden
12669,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden is lead into a critical callthere fixed it
12670,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i was waiting for it and the demented bastard’s staff actually went and did it
12671,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,a true man of the people 👎
12672,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,oh yeah his party benefited significantly from ftx fraud basically took retail invester money and lined the pockets of democrat election campaigns
12673,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,love how they jump to bitcoin and crypto right away instead of regulating the fucking criminal exchanges
12674,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,called it ftx was the setup for regulation and taxationcame with a few backhanders like  for the big guy
12675,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,you know what else is in critical the presidents ability to complete a sentence without stuttering
12676,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,they have a solution for problem they themselves created how nice
12677,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,people in control cant control people so they control variables  calling it money
12678,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,so return the donations
12679,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,its hunting season for us crypto 
12680,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,brandon loves talking shit he has no respect for laws nor regulations soon he wont have congress under his control anymore no one will take him seriously at least for the next  years he lies about things like his son dies in war and thinking hes above the law and can forgive student loans despite court tells him no money that people lost under all his stagflationary policies is greater than  ftx collapses combined he should look in the mirror for more rules that will regulate how government spend tax dollars
12681,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,how much money did he except from sbf this president is probably the most crooked president in history
12682,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,elonmusk needs to find a way to decentralize twitter fast or find a way to make it extremely hard to shut down
12683,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,it’s like there is a theme here…let’s influence something and cause it to break then step in and fox it by implementing terrible overreaching government controls  rinse and repeat
12684,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this is concerning given his track record president biden is destroying valuable things seemingly at the speed of light sigh…let’s hope things improve
12685,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,an exchange failed not btc rules should exist for exchanges not for crypto
12686,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,game change after he broke all rules and cheated cheers 
12687,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,run a laundry operation to convert money to party donations when caught call for regulation  gain more power and control must be nice
12688,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,big government looking to fuck up another thing and leech the money out of it
12689,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,oh no got to distract from their money laundering scheme with us taxpayer money by blaming crypto
12690,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,he was working for them the entire time planned demolition of cryptos
12691,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,after he and his party directly benefit from the ftx scam
12692,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,love that great grandpas are leading the discussion on bitcoin
12693,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,joe biden’s only goals are to line the pockets of his family and his political donors he’s as corrupt as they come he’s made a mockery of the office of the presidency and the united states
12694,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the government gave plenty of time more than  years in fact for the crypto community to prove they are able to selfregulate when left unsupervised but what we have seen is that crypto created an industry of scams never seen in the history of mankind
12695,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i so much just him and me want to ask biden what crypto is
12696,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,what does biden know about crypto cmon he’s probably just a talking head for a cabal that will drive that agenda
12697,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,when they say joe biden i guess they mean joes minders
12698,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,sbf really screwed us in more ways than one…
12699,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12, hahathis ought to be good i knew there was a purpose for the scandal
12700,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,one could argue that the sec and cftc already have the authority and legal framework to regulate crypto
12701,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,we want a free marketnot a government controlled rigged ass game
12702,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,us needs a president that’s up to date with latest technology developments and by the people for the people
12703,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this guy can go fk him self
12704,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,the only thing jb leads is himself the wrong way off stage in a building he’s spent  years “working” inside   sbf is the patsy this is probably the cyberpandemic claus schwab referred to awhile ago to herd people into cbdc  time will tell
12705,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this was all part of the plan i bet joe greatly appreciated the millions that sbf laundered to him sam will never see prison time
12706,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,well that explains why the ftx guy is getting away with stealing all that money it was a power play to try and control all crypto and his donation to the democratic party was their cut
12707,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,🖕
12708,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,eh… just what i need someone with dementia deciding if my investment makes money
12709,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this is a nightmare govt ruins everything it touches
12710,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,and who will regulate the regulators
12711,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,democrats hate the idea of decentralization
12712,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,this is an over reaction to the situation to cover up the fact sbf was the second biggest donor to the democratic party behind soros theres ongoing investigations into whether or not the dems benefitted from stolen funds from ftx users just remember that they dont mind getting all that money their way until they get caught

12751,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i’d give him a dollar if he could explain what crypto is without a teleprompter 😅
12752,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,i think we can still have decentralized with a few regulations to help protect us common folks however when some asshole from gs is brought in to write the regs its going to either choke out crypto or ensure rich fat cats have loop holes to abuse as always
12753,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,everything sbf did is already illegal
12754,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,just what decentralization needs regulation

12760,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,bitcoin and other decentralized applications dont need regulation maybe a legal framework for handling scams but thats itcexs though should be absolutely regulated audited and insured cant trust these bitches running these exchanges
12761,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,too late
12762,z041pu,2022-11-20 13:24:12,  the sector is huge financially but has very limited regulation the same problems would not have occurred in the mainstream financial systemhahahahaha
13063,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,years centuries hopefully

13066,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,its insulting to hear this clown um and uhh his way around when to me at least it seems like a lastditch act of stupidity to save his skin each and every time this fool speaks to the media he gives people who think crypto is a bullshit ponzi scheme more ammo every day he isnt in jail is confirmation for people who already hate this shit even for us who didnt have any losses on ftx we are still being fucked as a community by this guy
13067,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,yall it took years for elizabeth holmes from theranos to be arrested and thats even accounting for the pregnancy building up a case for these white collar crimes takes time i guarantee the hammer is coming
13068,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,bankmanfried admitted he had a “bad month” but denied committing fraud at his crypto exchangelmao this dude what he did was the definition of fraud
13069,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,bahamas government we can hand him over for a price
13070,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this is ridiculous he should be sentenced on how many years would take that  to earn for an average person i doubt that would take short of  lifetimeslets say average yearly wage in us is  x  that would be      effectively a lifetime wage of  people you fucked off with and embezzled that number would even pump up for people in  world countries its ridiculous that the justice system is only considering years as they put it
13071,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this was entirely predictable crypto is in its infancy and is unregulated this comes with being unregulated
13072,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,the government is building a case and it’s going to extensive and accurate no one is going to arrest him until thenpeople are under the false impression he only lose “poor peoples money” this schmuck had billionaires and millionaire investors too he might be connected enough to stay out of prison while they investigate but he is not connected enough to dive prosecution
13073,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,hopefully for more than just ‘years’
13074,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,you forget to  pay your  parking fine you get summoned into court within  monthsthis clown scammed billions worht of money and is even invited to tvshows launders even more money to the bahamas buys his parents hundreds of millions worth of real estate and goes on with his life and the biggest joke in the title is  he could  yeah we know all how this is going to end same as in  when after the truth come out only one banker got sent to jail you get a caught faster if you steal a snickers bar in the grocery store around the cornerwhat a fucking clown society we live in its so sad
13075,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,yo i just had a great idea rich people prison for when youre rich but have to spend like  years behind bars because you made the poors mad stole their life savings or something  itll be like regular prison but theres a pool you have your own cell with a nice bed fancy clothes fancy food your own modern computer with internet in the cell visitation rites guards who help you smuggle boygirlfriendspouseprostitutes in and ease of leaving to go home for holiday visits best of all everyone else inside is rich too
13076,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,we definitely want to arrest this guy who stole billions of dollars but were pretty busy arresting poor people for being poor
13077,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,everything is ready just a small detail like the actual arrest is missing
13078,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,i wouldn’t be shocked if this guy never saw a prison cell with how complicated the whole situation is his team of lawyers is going to have a field day muddying the waters for years then add in the fact that we don’t even have clear rules for how crypto is regulated you end up with a clusterfuck that no prosecutor will be able to untangle
13079,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,unbelievable bullshittery…
13080,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,don’t worry instead they’ll let him do various press tours where he’ll answer softball questions from spineless reporters who don’t actually understand the magnitude of the fraud he orchestrated while facing no consequences
13081,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,we need to read all of his emails and correspondence if he deleted his emails or toss away paperwork he clearly knew something and is hiding them
13082,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,a year for every  sounds fair
13083,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,biden nothing will fundamentally changetrump hire that guy to do my taxessbf yeah ill be fine

13192,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,turkey is seizing assets and cyprus is threatening criminal prosecution over the freezing of eu assets by the swiftly declared chapter  bankruptcy process there it would be a bad look for the doj to sit on its hands while offshore regulatory havens move proactively to amend what increasingly appears to be selfevident fraud and abuse
13193,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he has enough politicians in his pocket that he is not worried

13202,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,that’s a big ‘if’
13203,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,silk road guy shouldve donated to the politicians like this guy and hed be a free man
13204,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,heres what i think the issue is ceos never go to jail did enron execs get locked up how about the equifax guys who lost half the countries citizens social security numbers ceos are too big to fail if they jail this guy it could set a precedent that ceos are responsible for their companys fuckups ya know like they fucking should be
13205,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,why would they arrest him after purposely setting the scenario up to make it seem like he’s the problem 
13206,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,it will never happen the people he funded and gave that money to own the fbi hes safe
13207,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,what did he do that was illegal  honest question  he obviously lost a lot of peoples money but what did he do that was fraudulent
13208,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,pony show
13209,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they have to get all the poor people who made ¢ off of bitcoin and forgot to file it in their taxes first
13210,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,ftx founder sam bankmanfried is already under investigation by numerous agencies but arresting him isn’t going to be straightforwardthe former crypto titan has the sec cftc sdny and doj on his case but it’ll take months if not years to fully assemble all the evidencein america it is not a crime to be a lousy or careless ceo with poor judgement during his recent press tour from a remote location in the bahamas bankmanfried really leaned into his own ineptitude largely blaming ftx’s collapse on poor risk management    at least a dozen times in a conversation with andrew ross sorkin he appeared to deflect blame to caroline ellison his counterpart and onetime girlfriend at alameda he says didn’t know how extremely leveraged alameda was and that he just didn’t know about a lot of things going on at his vast empire    bankmanfried admitted he had a “bad month” but denied committing fraud at his crypto  story isnt gonna be done anytime soon we will be hearing it well into the next bull run
13211,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,the usa is more interested in the  dollars you sent over venmo
13212,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,can we just call this guy sam fried do we really need the hyphenation
13213,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he wont spend a single day in prison
13214,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,the fucker deserves it too
13215,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he should be the one asking to be in custody it’s safer for him to be kept away from the people he screwed over
13216,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,lol lets be reminded that news doesnt last give it  weeks and sammy will be living his best life while we all trip over each other on the newest headline
13217,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,when not if
13218,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,wtf is with skinny nerds with afros in crypto
13219,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,yeah i would hope so
13220,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,i think the guillotine is reasonable here right
13221,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,so if i react on an sbf article i get moons that was how it works right
13222,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,so how viable is a bounty to get him to the us or a country that has extradition treaties
13223,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,remember folks the irs can and will come after you for discretions under  they don’t care who you voted for people here in this thread will be audited and intimidated for less than  i had a year long audit for  in deductions they didn’t believe i had to hand over my entire financial life on paper the size of a phone book to prove it was justified and then there is this guy who they can’t and won’t prosecute because when it comes down to it the irs has a lot of power but not a lot of talent
13224,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this shit is nothing to whats going on in the actual financial markets  compared to  trillion
13225,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they wont arrest him because his crime massively benefitted the banks by fucking cryptoif people didnt hold their money in somebody elses wallet this wouldnt even really have been an issue right
13226,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,soros said when it comes to making money i dont see people i see tools its a competition to make money not to please people thats their business model
13227,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,do we need gob help now
13228,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he is still not arrested us authorities realy got corrupted that much bernie madoff already was in jail
13229,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,but don’t worry he’ll get a slap on the wrist and  hours probation
13230,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he donated to the right people and groups that will protect him
13231,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,a family member of mine served  years for wire fraud and his total payout was  the total money stolen was like  million dollars this guy probably won’t see a day behind bars
13232,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,i think they’re all too busy congratulating him on being so willing to talk to the media about all of it
13233,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,lol
13234,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,the us land of the free
13235,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he has too much leverage over high ranking politicians to get serious prison time with how sensational epstein became i would expect a little more finesse this time around from the corrupt officials involved hell probably get  years in a luxury white collar prison released in  and fines that hell never pay off that is my bold prediction anyway
13236,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50, what if sbf is successful in making his block a polyamorous free love prison block
13237,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,dont you know after you steal a billion dollars or more youre more likely to get  years hell maybe even  years in prison steal between a million and anything less than a billion you get  years easily so the moral of the story is go big or go home
13238,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they wont he paid off the right people so unless this gets massive publicity from here on out and people keep pressing for punishment nothing will happen
13239,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,put him in jail already
13240,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,i want him in jail just so i can stop seeing his face everywhere
13241,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,jail wishful thinking he bribed people in congress he will go testify in front of them and they will sweep it under the rug as long as he makes more donations to their bank accounts
13242,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,mf
13243,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,bernie madoff was a free man for about  hours after the collapse of his house of cards bernie madoff robbed some of the richest people in the world  the only explanations for sbf not being picked up at all yet have to be he didnt rob the uber wealthy somehow and hes the perfect fall guy for some really heavy hitters that wanted to take crypto out pumping an entire sector has to pay dividends alamedaftx were doing a fuckload of dirty laundry for peopleentitiescartels etc post panama papers
13244,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,all that money was funneled into politics he literally donated  million  of users funds to dems looks like he wont be getting arrested
13245,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,helps when youre party to the second biggest democrat donor in the country
13246,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50, scam wankman fraud
13247,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,so like it usually takes a bit of time i hear enron guy wasnt arrested for a bit theranos trial just finished madoff confessed
13248,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,dude is taking his sweet time not that i dont want justice to be served but if i was him id be gone already he needs to disappear in thailand or something lol
13249,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he should face is more like it he was not alone in this though and some attention should be placed on the others too
13250,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,if they were using ftx for meme stock swaps they might be working with him rather than arresting
13251,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,tf first it was  billion then  billion then  billion now its  billion
13252,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,hes in the pockets of many liberal and some conservative politicians hell never get arrested
13253,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,unless the extradition treat has expired it seems the bahamas has one with the us so either the us hasnt put it in the bahamas isnt doing it or there is some other mysterious circumstancedevils advocate though financial crimes especially this high need solid cases to get the extradition we can say and point out look how obvious this is but if a judge wont approve it they wont try until they have enough
13254,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,big if true
13255,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,will they arrest him though hes all the way over there and going to get him would mean they have to get up from their nap
13256,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,rules for thee not for me
13257,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,does anyone how a good write up on the crimes he committed that would fall within us jurisdiction
13258,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this smacks of familiarity
13259,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they taking their sweet time doing so it seems must be nice
13260,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they wont arrest him since he funneled money to the democrats plus the intelligence agencies support democrats
13261,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,in reality he wont lest not forget he donated  millions that give him some type of  immunity
13262,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,kim dotcoms island was invaded by special forces but this guy stealing billions and nobody cares
13263,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,maybe he ripped off a bunch of russian oligarchs and theres a surplus of polonium
13264,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,in china this guy would be shot already say what you will about the chinese they do not i’ve any special treatment to rich criminals
13265,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,both r  d received donations so why hurry
13266,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,key words if the us ever gets around to arresting himif he does get convicted and sentenced i sense hell get a slap on the wrist given all of his political donations
13267,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,itll never happen if hes not in jail today he wont be ever
13268,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,if i were him i would be looong gone by now
13269,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,maybe in a couple decades remember epstein the justice system does not exist
13270,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,woah woah woah don’t rush to arrest him have we even considered letting him open another exchange just to make sure it wasn’t a one off have we even tried loaning him another couple of billion people are so quick to jump to conclusions
13271,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,should face life in prison
13272,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they just couldnt stand to see a young jewish boy make it in america 😢i know you didnt do it sam 
13273,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,as they should also what about mashinsky
13274,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,sweet  perhaps he will have developed the sbf token that will be used to buy goods at the prison commissary
13275,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,gonna be at least five years before hes extradited from bahamas  hes got plenty of money for lawyers itll be several years before he faces an actual prison cell
13276,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,sbf is only the fall guy look for the man behind the curtain he has done this before as a test run not with billons but millions and it worked so well he did it again
13277,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,well how receptive is the bahamas to extradition requests that alone is probably the biggest hurdle
13278,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,if the us dont get him someone will way too money to disappear you know someone somewhere is super pissed with this guy
13279,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he most likely thought many times  billions dollars is worth my life in prison for generational family wealth
13280,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,the problem with this guy it’s that he was given such a free pass of financial freedom that basically he does what any scammer do but he started to think that because it’s him doing it should be okhe started to live on a parallel world where crimes became financial sophisticated tricks and he was the magicianhe really thinks he don’t belong to prison
13281,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he will not do much time if any at all  look at trump  look at elizabeth holmes in her fancy apartment prison  its a joke  the doj is a joke
13282,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,could but wont
13283,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,and his parents
13284,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,too many influential people involved with him for him to fail
13285,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this just says “go steal and hide billions of dollars you do a quick stint at club fed and then you’re free to live like a billionaire with the money you stole”he needs to go to jail for life for this and everyone else at ftx needs to be investigated and have similar sentences if they were part of this
13286,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,lol this guy paid the right people to make sure he doesn’t go to jail its fucking insane that he still walks around free
13287,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,could face but not will face because they cant guarantee it will happen or not
13288,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,you dont arrest someone until you can charge them with criminal offenses shortly thereafter   theranos took  years to investigate   if you want this sleezeball to prison sadly its going to take some time
13289,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,nahhhhhhh
13290,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,people complain about regulation but also want him to rot in jail i say he’s fine your issue for leaving funds on the exchange there’s no reason to even with slow moving coins like bitcoin
13291,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,you mean he had a job after losing  billion
13292,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,could if i go to a store right now and steal a bread ill go to jail
13293,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this article made me feel so much better about the situation its semimainstream unflattering coverage on sbfs criminal activity and baffling lack of consequences so comprehensive that you could get away with taking just this article and have the whole story very nice and with quotes from respected crypto people as wellheres the biggest thing i took away from this article though sbf is armed with the most expert legal defense his stolen money and powerful family can buy if the prosecution rushes this process takes a shot and misses then there is no retrial the evidence must be irrefutable and beyond a shadow of a doubt for a jury of people that likely dont understand anything about crypto investing or business else we cannot reach a guilty verdictthe truth is plainly obvious to this sub but convincing unaware parties outside this echo chamber is a much trickier operation
13294,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,doubt it
13295,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,fraud is the kind of criminal charge that can put you behind bars for life with bankmanfried the question is whether he misled ftx customers to believe their money was available and not being used as collateral for loans or for other purposes according to renato mariotti a former federal prosecutor and trial attorney who has represented clients in derivativerelated claims and securities class actions “it sure looks like there’s a chargeable fraud case here” said mariotti “if i represented mr bankmanfried i would tell him he should be very concerned about prison time that it should be an overriding concern for him”lock him up
13296,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,well the us doesnt punish its white collar criminals so hell likely never be arrested
13297,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,please stop sbf postsi cant read about this dumbfuck anymore
13298,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,they aren’t going to arrest them those that arewill be paid off are parading him around asking him how he did it

13301,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,dude paid off all the right people i don’t think he would be giving interviews unless he’s totally insane or he has agreements that so long as he makes it look like incompetence vs criminal act they won’t go after him he’s basiclly going to go around making himself look as stupid as possible and taking all the blame he can because it gives him the chance to blame it on being stupid instead of criminal nothing is going to happen after he is done with his tour of stupidity he will disappear and live off the kajillion dollars he’s hidden under other peoples names he will get sued a ton he will declare bankruptcy and then vanish to live in his moms  bedroom basement on her private island
13302,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this is what i’m telling people he isn’t walking if there’s fraud if anyone recently watched the cftc meeting with senators then it’s clear they are taking this ftx collapse very seriously and are investigating it with a fine comb the issue now is that regulation is on its way and will be sooner rather than later some or objects will be labelled as securities and some won’t
13303,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he would be in prison if he stole from the super richlook at madoff and recently holmes no one care if you steal from poor people
13304,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,with how much he is involved with us politicians i wouldnt be surprised if hell get suicided eventually
13305,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,he’s gonna walk watch
13306,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,what about his girlfriend and the rest who all need investigating
13307,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,why is it even a question if he is going to jail is the us justice system really that broken

13309,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,is this different than mashinsky and teams shitty antics the possibility of and call for prison time seems greater here for some reason someone  here

13312,zd6khi,2022-12-05 13:18:50,this is probably a civil action not a criminal case due to lack of jurisdiction theres a reason sams father structured these shell companies in the countries that he did

13693,yyhm1t,2022-11-18 11:15:32,in that interview i saw of her i got a bad vibe of typical nerd arrogance and selfabsorption so im not surprised shes a racist i absolutely hate that idea of racial hierarchy and dog eat dog principles applied to human relations i wonder how common it is in financial circles to actually belief in that garbage i guess now she can face the full darwinian extent of her foolishness along with sbf not so nice when youre on the other end is it in relation to this type of worldview i found plenty of it in nerd circles at university such types liked to place people into discrete categories and said tired edgy shit like a benign dictatorship is the best way to run a society except you cant run a society or treat people like a computer program with a hierarchical tree ugh they were in love with the idea of their own intelligence and precocity it was suffocating i see a similar dynamic here

15288,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this is all orchestrated by sbf and others involved to taint custodial records so the records cannot be submitted in a future trial do not log in
15289,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,sad days for cryptos long day today watching news

15292,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,glad i deleted the app when this whole mess started i did not have anything on there and was just using the dashboard for prices
15293,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i signed up with ftx and used the app to monitor my crypto thank fuck i never traded with them i noticed the app stopped working followed your advice and unistalled
15294,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,yeah right definitely an insider job they filed for bankruptcy all their assets will be submitted to court for proceedings so the execs definitely want to get their own asses covered first by moving funds out and into their own accounts and go live in some remote country as multimillionaire while the poor ftx users get miserable compensation
15295,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,you know how people tells you to get your own wallet and all i see is more and more ways how to get into those said walletssometimes i feel like my coins are safer on coinbase than self custody wallet
15296,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,is there anything like blockolio out there thats the only reason i had thr ftx app bastards stole blockfolio and now killed it
15297,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,can i ask who audited ftt token  who were ftx auditors  there’s gotta be some firm right
15298,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,convincing customers to delete their ftx app is one way to prevent them from making withdrawals
15299,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,jesus and yet the ftt price its not crashing to  like what happened with luna wtf
15300,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,things are really going bad on thisi am so shock xd 
15301,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this was a money heist orchestrated and well planned this is when big companies come in and buy everything up for pennie’s on the dollar
15302,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,cant we just blacklist these adresses since we can track them thank the blockchain technology
15303,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,who said they were unauthorised and why should we believe them
15304,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,they even not start such news with breaking or just in
15305,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,we might see a pump in monero as these criminals launder the funds of ftx users
15306,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,binance is also playing big gamethey know ftx have problem than why they dont disable the ftt trade to save the people loosing big moneyits same thing happening like luna
15307,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it’s not a hack is itscam banker fraud about to run…

15310,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,the world is not big enough for sbf to stay hidden same with do kwon just a matter of time for both of them
15311,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,do not update ftx app delete the app just to be sure reports of funds getting drained on updating the app might be infected with malware as wellmore than  million drained many users balance now showing as zero
15312,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,remember according to sbf ftx’s “exchange” was coded by sbf and a handful of coders in a matter of monthsyou cannot expect secure bug free software without a real development life cycle its impossiblethis was inevitable

15331,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,its crazy to me how bad this wenthow could a company once being thought of as extremely safe and strong go down like this and so fasthow can they be so greedy
15332,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i call bs owners saw a way to get some assets out of a burning building while claiming some hacker did them dirty muddying the waters
15333,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,likely insider job i don’t know how a hacker can push the updates on app store or google store without the app credentials or the op is making things up since i don’t see any linked articles or whatever proofs
15334,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,if you publish such a post isnt it normal and common sense to at least name one source
15335,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,definitely not a hack
15336,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,idk but if i were associated at all with ftx i would be scared shitless of people coming for mestraight up not condoning any violence but as it was said in the big lebowski you do not fuck a stranger in the ass larrysamanother note that sam kid looks a lot like that dipshit kid from the movie no coincidence
15337,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,are people experiencing this on the ftxus app
15338,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,banker here contact your bank and request a stop payment on ftx and then remove it later if you need to word of advice dont ever trade or invest through one of your main bank accounts create another one specific to transactions like this in case of compromises
15339,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,what is the version number of the compromised app does it affect both the ftx blockfolio and ftx pro apps and on both android and ios platforms
15340,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,so what if you only used apis on the app and used it for news and monitoring a portfolio therefore nothing connected money wise other than another exchange ls read only api more or less wondering to what extent one has to worry
15341,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,jesus christ hack my ass these fcks need to go straight to the slammer how greedy can they get

15346,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i read an article that said sbf used a backdoor to transfer funds without triggering alerts so he planned this from the start
15347,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,glad i closed my account as soon as this all started
15348,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i dont have an ftx account is it still possible to register as a new user
15349,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i’ve stored cryptos into cold storage since late  people who didn’t do this are low iq and deserved to get rugged
15350,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,thought u can follow anything to everywhere over the blockchain
15351,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,at this point i will just wait for the netflix miniseries about this

15357,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,just do not forget about matt kohrs charging his followers and fans money so he could tell them all about how great ftx was and how best to invest in it hahahaha
15358,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,crypto is finished for  years the only people pushing for other people to buy are the people who put a lot of cash in and are trying to get newbies to buy so they can sell
15359,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,but crypto is the future
15360,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,too busy chasing parents that speak up about pedophile teachers
15361,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,don’t worry all wallets are insured by tom brady matt damon and lebron james

15363,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,for me and many it does not matter much as our live savings are already gone there is nothing that could be spent get out if you can guys at least with a greater part
15364,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,hey my bank account has been accessed by ftx via plaid today please everyone disconnect plaid from your bank accounts asap

15366,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,translation “don’t open the apps while we rug pull thx suckers”
15367,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,yes  not your keys not your money  did saylor store his own coins i bet its in some custody partner sollution nobody wants to hold that amount of coin personallyall those custody partners can exit  the same way security has holes especially internally in companies
15368,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,in other words the greater fools game almost ending
15369,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43, years with crypto and i totally lose my trust on crypto afther this day

15371,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,what if you have fiat parked on ftx for limit orders lets say i assume thats gone too
15372,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43, billion wasn’t enough he wanted the rest so he stopped everyone from taking it out and stole it
15373,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,they probably in shock and panic or think it’s part of the process of a bankruptcy and will be restored later you never know i think i’d panic and don’t comment at first either 
15374,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,is it possible ftx are hacking themselves to get away with some money before bankruptcy
15375,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i thought the whole thing was supposed to be like… decentralized and safe lmao wtf
15376,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,its probably in everyones interest to monitor any bank accounts or cards attached to ftxand use something like credit karma and make sure no new credit cards or loans open up in your namewe dont know the degree of this hack yet this could be a shit show
15377,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,wait you mean that a system that is designed to be free from external regulations might actually get fucked from not having external regulationspikachu face
15378,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i guess i’m glad i live in ny as they are very strict about crypto exchanges we really only have coinbase and gemini
15379,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it isnt hacked it is intended as planned it is a giant ponzi scheme since the beginning
15380,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,is it possible since they have our bank info to drain money from our banks
15381,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it just keeps getting better

15405,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,hacked right as all this is going on if you believe that then you should put all your life savings into whatever sbf cooks up next
15406,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this ftx debacle is going so crazy its creating a checklist for future crypto exchanges and how bad they need to be to reach this level of incompetence
15407,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i bet my  moons that this is an insidejob hackers my ass they wouldve hacked the exchange before it went downhill
15408,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,what a shitshow

15425,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this is not hackers inside people pretending like it’s hackers
15426,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this is very bad for the entire crypto world and is setting us back years
15427,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,can we go more than a few months without some crypto scandal people are getting scammed left and right  this is not a good look
15428,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,the plot thickens
15429,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,wow the balls on whoever did this  insider job someones going to jail
15430,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i have no money in ftx but im so sick of this shit btc  eoy
15431,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,then expect a guaranteed  btc dump
15432,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,what a shit show and i thought luna was bad… lol💀
15433,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it might be an inside jobit certainly is no way it isnt
15434,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,jesus what a shit show the whole ftx shit is i didnt think id see anything worse than terra luna not that this is necessarily worse but seeing an exchange go through this is ludacris
15435,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i just liked blockfolio
15436,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,been hacked is the new way of saying we dont have any money left so we cant pay you out easy way to pass the blame and exit scam i guess convenient that they chosen now to hack it
15437,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,why assume hack instead of assuming inside job
15438,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,damn it really is all kicking off im glad i never opened that ftx account i was considering a couple months ago
15439,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i’m so thankful cryptocom destroyed their debit card  they made my delegation drop in value and caused me to lose faith in all custodial services  i was this close to signing up w ftx and bc cryptocom fucked us over they prevented me from starting an acct there
15440,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,uh oh
15441,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it’s a heist
15442,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i used ftx before only put like  in it and the interfaceoptions were so nice it’s amazing and sad that the owner and ceo chose to abuse consumer funds go into leverage and back its own assets with its own cointhe lawsuits will be massive
15443,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,the only reason i had the ftx app was because they bought blockfolio and i used it to track my portfolio never had any fund on it still delete
15444,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,what i have trouble wrapping my mind around is that most everyone knows or should know unless they believe in clickbait youtube ads that  trading is not profitable for most people and  not your keys not your coins  why have so many people forgotten these simple rules
15445,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,the movie will play out like a mash up of catch me if you can and the social network what actors do we want in it  the screenplay is pretty much already written …
15446,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,alex mashinsky 😱
15447,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,just when i was thinking that ftx couldn’t possibly get any worse
15448,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,ftxwhat a shit show this week
15449,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this ftx stuff looks mighty stable and useable how do i get started using it
15450,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i deleted the app yesterday and deleted my account there completely but if insiders are doing this no one is safe  i don’t think that you data will be automatically deleted and that they do not have the access anymore  i just hope that all stuff from ftx will rot in prison
15451,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,can you really call it a hack when it’s obviously insiders looting on their way out
15452,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,the hack was probably installed by sbf himself or one of his cronies
15453,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,fix is in
15454,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i would suggest if you ever had ftx apps installed on your phone  i would make sure to transfer any crypto on my phone to a cold wallet  change all my passwords for everything  do a factory wipe on the phone
15455,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,the future of finance
15456,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,fbi agent assigned to task…  meets ceo in question fbi agent’s  cripto wallet start’s going off he looks at the  billion doge he just received… calls boss ahhh no crime here broseph

15459,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it would be great if the hackers found a way to send their pillage directly to the people sbf fucked over like a wholesome chaotic good hacker who just wanta to fuck sbf and give all the people ftx fooled into investing in their fucking scheme
15460,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,well the money definitely went to the moon

15462,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,apparently sbf is in argentina imho this hack is all part of the theatricsps rumors are spreading that sbf had a blind back door to all ftx accounts wow
15463,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,as someone who had a small amount of money on here back when it was block folio it changed hands and i should assume theres no way to get that money backim coming into finding out about this late as i had just given up and let the coins sit there should i delete the app i dont think its updated in some time last time i tried to log in it asked for the wallet info which i did not enter
15464,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,ok now this has surpassed netflix documentary and entered into adam  mckay film territory

15478,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,hacking is the new bankruptcy
15479,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,recovery for account holders actually could be close to  at least celcius will pay back    heck they look like good guys in comparison to ftx right now
15480,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,no banks need authorisation from you you should have  on your account for every transaction if they do the bank has to give it back
15481,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,lol okay noob
15482,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,yes it can be a big hack but from themselve  cheers 
15483,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,it’s almost like this whole crypto thing is one giant fraud backed by nothing…weird
15484,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i hated this company from the first shit ad they shoved in my face
15485,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i don’t understand this either you have access to limited number of private keys in which case you take all of it in  seconds or you dont have access they make it sound like its a small hole in a wall and you stand in a line to grab cash as much as you can and flee the scene before you get caught
15486,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,as far as i know and beauty of crypto is that every single move is documented and steps can be traced in the blockchain
15487,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,good for bitcoin in big picture
15488,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this shit just keeps getting betterfucking crypto chads always shoot themselves in their own foot
15489,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,dont open the app and dont go to the website while we figure how to squeeze the remainder of your funds
15490,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,that’s a pretty quick turnaround on developing the code to create a hack at this level it had to be preprogrammed into the system
15491,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this is like a soap opera now every day some new drama 🫣
15492,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,this is setting up a precedence everytime an exchange is feeling the heat or going bankrupt you can expect a hack hacks everywhere
15493,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,those solana hacks a while back maybe worth having a closer look at by someone with the technical know how
15494,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,“hacked”…probably back door built on purpose lmao
15495,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,that’s insane
15496,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i think this is the biggest crypto crisis of ……so far
15497,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,ftx was hacked and the corporate jet flew to argentina  i am thinking a few cartels might be involved
15498,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,hack  its sbf and his minions
15499,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,we should start a hunter cointoken when you buy it you contribute to a team of bounty hunters who will deliver these monsters to the relevant authorities
15500,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,is this the future of finance you people talk about so much
15501,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,ive had to delete the app fuck
15502,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,looking at the main two wallets associated with fuckftx namely  and is it possible going by the second someone from shib is behind the hack or involved in ftx look at the tokens holding for me the max graph looks identical to that of shib just a brain fart
15503,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,no this is them stopping anyone going on while they drain it of every cent
15504,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,hacked  the term the owners use so they can steal money before shit goes completely under
15505,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,is there anymore left to take  anyone got the etherscan
15506,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,protection of chainlink is down even link stolen time dumping chainlink
15507,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,not a hack but a well planned move that would take weeks or even months to come up with whoever did this knew what was going to happen to ftx and prepared well and waited for the perfect moment to hit the button and take the money out
15508,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,do we have any actual evidence of this supposed trojan people keep talking abouta virus detection for example
15509,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,hacker is sbf
15510,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,based true take no one is private who lives in the current society the five eyes and all the things snowden whistle blowed about are still happening at large

15514,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,brilliant actually call it a hack halt withdrawals and allow vcs sequoia pantera tiger global etc to pull their cash out
15515,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i assume  of ftx users if you dont have some bahamas mobster relationship its gone
15516,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,can someone explain to me where all the money goes in ftx as they filed bankruptcy like where does all the money left in the business go 
15517,ysxikf,2022-11-12 05:28:43,i just use the ftx app to track values on my holdings because blockfolio turned into it when ftx bought them can we just have blockfolio back me and my hardware wallet have no interest in any of this mess
15840,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,ironicthe “savior of crypto” who pushed for regulations was the shadiest
15841,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13, billion in liabilities  million in assets  billion in hard assets that need to be sorted outabsolutely fucked any other entity with large exposure to this is a sinking ship and you need to bail
15842,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,add ftx and blockfi to the reasons why i will not be invited to thanksgiving and christmas this year alongside luna celsius voyager and 
15843,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,damn  looks like i’m going to have to redo my  thanksgiving family crypto powerpoint
15844,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,the thing is this is just a start it will take weeks to months to unravel the damages this is going to cost
15845,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,ftx was as mainstream as it gets thanks to their huge advertising and sponsorship deals secondlargest exchange on the planet your parents might have bought the bitcoin on ftx this situation isn’t comparable to the earlier crypto wild west frauds like mt gox weird japanese site for magic cards or even quadrigacx relatively small loss of approx  this failure will take down a lot of people who have been the biggest bag holders of all and now those bags are gone not only that but we find out ftx has been actively trading against their own clients and that other exchanges may also be doing this as wellthis is catastrophic reputational damage to crypto as a wholeedit for people getting upset about my description of mt gox it’s how it would likely appear to someone outside what was at the time a very small communityi’m definitely not suggesting it wasn’t a dominant force and that it wasn’t disastrous at the time  but rather that this situation is worse when mt gox failed there were  affected customers and the market cap of the entirety of crypto was around  billion ftx has over a million customers and the market cap as of today is around  billion and of course has been more than triple this at its peak mt gox was proportionally larger but ftx will represent a much larger loss to a much larger group of people  and will attract much more attention from both the public and regulators
15846,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,coolcool cool cool
15847,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,and once again sbf lied to all of us blatantlya few days ago he said on his stupid apology that ftx us is completly fine in all caps just shows that even during the last hours he had nothing in mind but to lie to us
15848,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,oh boy here comes another dump hold tight boys

15857,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,this was obvious to happen now ftx was really hoping for  fundraising for a collapsed exchangecrazy week we had here
15858,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,i never understood why everyone started acting like ftx was some big trusted name in crypto they were brandspankingnew just like all the other newbies that have crumbled zero track record yet they were seen on the same level as cb kraken and binance which have been around for way longer and have survived  ftx was nothing but was seen as a legend
15859,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,a lot of people are about to learn what unsecured creditor means
15860,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,this sack of shit just yesterday was saying that us ftx users are fine 🤣🤣🤣

15874,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,im starting to think that the theory that we will never see all time highs again could be true especially looking at all these scammers mismanaging users funds who in their right mind would want to start investing in crypto after this debacle

15879,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,i just dont see the benefit in using exchanges when you could use digital wallets thats the whole point of crypto i have used coinbase and binance but only as a tool to send the tokens into a digital wallet and use  protocols to trade i dont get it
15880,ysbvon,2022-11-11 14:20:13,they are being fucking stupid again and again and people are just not learning right now here man they are stupid and nothing can change that shit for real

16423,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,he openly admitted to it being a ponzy scheme in an interview he didnt call it a ponzi scheme but what he was describing was one the interviewers started laughing once they realized what he was doing
16424,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,i watched that whole interview i’ve attended plenty of conferences with an economic focus it was very weird financial interview for several reasons  aaron ross sorkin’s stern dad voice coupled with sam bankmanfried teenager in trouble slump  nervous leg shaking made me keep forgetting that i was listening to a top flight financial investigative reporter interview the ceo of a former unicorn  the vibe or tone was very you are in big trouble buddy and unprofessional  the first half was muddled and questions jumped all over the place sbf did a lot of verbal wandering around i expected better from sorkin for example sbf responded to sorkin’s question about bahamas residential property purchased byfor his parents two stanford law professors with some waffley “they were never going to live there long term” or something and that they were living in the property while they “did some work” for his company what no follow up sloppy  sorkin asking if vc firma like sequoia who invested in ftx and thus contributed to its veneer of legitimacy carried some blame for ftx’s failure to manage its exposure to risk by failing to do proper due diligence are you kidding me  i agreed with sbf’s answer which was essentially sequoia judged the potential upside worth the risk has sequoia imploded no they took a risky bet and lost that’s vc i don’t understand what the hell sorkin was trying to do here  why did sbf do the interview it was so soft stern dad voice aside… i kinda feel like it was arranged it felt like sbf wanted to shape the court of public opinion with a “i got in over my head” defense and sorkin soft pitched why that i don’t know
16425,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,most expensive apology ever
16426,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,the user wrote andrew can you please ask sbf why he decided to steal my life savings and the  billion more from customers to give to his hedge fund alameda  please ask him if he thinks what happened was fraud    sorkin added that he had gotten several similar letters before asking bankmanfried what do you tell this man    i am deeply sorry about what happened he replied     bankmanfried added that the ftxus platform was still fully funded and he believed withdrawals could be opened up today    he then went on a long explanation of alamedas risky trade positions before blaming an allout pr assault which led to a total market collapse in a pretty short period of timelater on in the dealbook interview sbf also said he doesnt think hes criminally liable for ftxs implosion
16427,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21, i didnt knowingly commingle fundsbullshit
16428,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,thats alright guys he apologized i bet the customer is satisfied now

16490,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,we should ask the customer if the bank that holds their mortgage accepts apologizes as payment i hope they settled all their expenses before putting two mill in this exchange good grief
16491,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,uh why was anyone keeping  million of their “life’s savings” on ftx  or any exchange
16492,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,never trust your life saving money with cexs that is why we have god damn crypto wallets
16493,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,this is incredible why why just why putting your life savings into crypto or even worse a crypto exchange this makes me  million into a spy etf is a generational amount of money just put it there and let it grow forever take what you need and leave it alone why gambling it into crypto is beyond meyes sbf is a criminal but going that  hard riskon on gambling and being greedy is the way to desaster
16494,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,he apologized well i guess everything is fine then
16495,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,steal a car and god to prison steal someones entire life savings and go on a media tour and say sorry if the govt can serve justice id be fine with street justicehudge funds will steal your pension and wont even apologize white collar crime causes more pain and suffering than most physical robbery
16496,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,yeah honestly i don’t even feel bad you have millions on exchange and not cold storage like at that point it’s just on you ftx not a proper brokerage

16498,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,first of all i dont buy his excuses but even if its true that he didnt mean to scam he still messed up and the way he handle users fund is very irresponsible  he should pay his consequences 
16499,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,where are the brazen bulls when you need them
16500,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,sbf is a prime example of moral relativism
16501,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,the guy is already feeling better after the apologies lol
16502,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,at least he got an apology it’s all good now s

16504,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,this whole thing smells fishy i think gary gensler set up this whole shit show with the help of former student at mit  sbf in order to create anger and skepticism in congress and in the public eye in order to get lawmakers on his side all smoke and mirrorswe all know that the big wallstreet banks dont want crypto unless they can control and manipulate it its funny how the top cop only goes after legitimate crypto conpanies that scare wallstreet and at the same time havent protected retail investors from the real crooks in the space jp morgan and black rock allreadygot their claws in bitcoin and etherium so they are using gary gensler and the sec to destroy the rest of the competition  total corruption
16505,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,honestly anyone with  million as their entire life savings being  on ftxkinda deserves itwhy were they not diversifiedhow the fuck does someone with  million keep  in crypto  no stocks no bonds no real estatehow can one be smart enough to accumulate  million but dumb enough to not just invest in only crypto but also store it on a centralized exchangeits like hitting the lottery taking a literal cash lump sum in physical fiat place in duffel bags and storing it in your car  then being shocked when the car gets broken intoedit  deserves might have been a poor choice of words  but im  sure this person didnt earn it working over a long career and saving  most likely a shit coin winner who was financially illiterate
16506,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,“sorry about that need a hug”
16507,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,ahh if he said sorry  everything is fine 🚬

16517,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,the lack of eye contact and shaking sbf was doing was cringe

16565,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,lets be honest when you know something is unregulated there are inherent risks involved most if not all of us in our naive excitement of this trend breaking potentially limitless opportunity  let our guard down

16615,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,someone should’ve diversified their investments rather than put it all on ftx

16617,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,sam was smirking  smiling most of the time what a psychopath
16618,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,“apologized” like any rich prick who has never had to take accountability in his life before  by chuckling first then taking a deep breath and reading off the apology flash card his lawyer gave him
16619,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,scummy isnt even strong enough of a word anymore this shit sucks
16620,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,does him apologising give any legal grounds to prosecute
16621,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,cant understand people who put so much money on an exchange
16622,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,if that was me i would spend every last penny i owned to meet sam facetoface
16623,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,for a moment i thought this was the onion
16624,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,its easy to critisize this individual nowbut back a year ago everyone thought this was fine because of the euphoria mania happening if you dont nelieve me scroll to the posts from  yo  yr ago
16625,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,i bet that customer is already joking about losing  million to ftx after that apology
16626,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,i mean he said he was sorry whats  milly in the face of a heartfelt apology
16627,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,its too late to apologize
16628,z9utz3,2022-12-01 18:07:21,“accused” the former ceo of stealing it how about he did steal it media whitewashing sbf is disgusting

16976,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,from what i understand at this point is that alameda had inappropriate levels of borrowing power from ftx when loans came due that alameda had to pay they paid them using credit from ftx  ftx didnt have appropriate oversight into how much alameda was borrowing and they basically robbed the bank at that point with proper oversight credit limitations and segmentation alameda should have been the only entity to go under as it was unable to pay for loans without the line of credit from ftx please correct if you see any issue with this explanation
16977,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,sbf has quite possibly pulled off the biggest scam in history

17105,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,this all seems just way to insane  i’m not a tin foil hat guy but i can’t help but think this isn’t a distraction from something   this is absolutely insane
17106,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,well if they miscount his jail sentence i’m sure someone will get to him
17107,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,“oops”

17111,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,they should misaccount his arse into a prison cell until he pays back all his investors he scammed
17112,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hmm sad thing is we cant do anything to this guy that is worth that much moneymaybe life sentence very unlikely but will it worth billions he stole  nah not encouraging violence dont get me wrong here we just need fairly transparent system here not complete transparent but something easier atleast
17113,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,good thing the irs’s cracking down relentlessly on  venmo income but turning a blind eye on this kind of shit
17114,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oh yea  billion dollar whoops lets chalk it up to a rounding error and go grab some lunch

17118,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,they were high on drugs while doing group orgies shit happened
17119,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,ftx donated  million to gop  million to dem  the narrative that this is a problem for democrats only needs to be clarified they were donating to anyone that would push for regulation that benefited them on both sides of the aisle
17120,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,was this the      distraction    billion type of thing
17121,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,the thing that impresses me is just how much of a whitewash  platform for an aww shucks narrative this guy is getting its like the ultimate media hall pass
17122,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i have always defended crypto as being pretty straight forward and not a ponzi scheme and this guy comes along and blows all of that out of the water with a straight forward ponzi scheme
17123,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,why the hell do people believe him he is a thief a criminal just because mommy and poppy are from the upper intellectual class doesnt change that i hope one day we call fraud something like  he did a fried  instead of ponzi
17124,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oopsies
17125,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,arent you supposed to be qualified to be an accountant just blatantly admitting negligence because he knows hes untouchable
17126,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,and he manages to get away with it sigh one of my friends lost money in this
17127,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i mean since when have accounting skills been recommended for managing billions of dollars of other people’s money s
17128,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,this should equal to  billion years in a high security penitentiary
17129,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hate what that happens fr
17130,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,as far as i understand it alameda was allowed to have a margin position on ftx without getting liquidated which can go well until the position goes so far in the red that liquidity runs out so indirectly they were borrowing money from the others that were tradingsbf must have decided to do it this way because he thought alameda has a lot of collateral they can post if necessary but then realized when cz announced that they would dump ftt tokens that the collateral is all shitcoins and can just collapse instantly also accepting your own exchange tokens as collateral is a terrible ideaalso the way that this transpired is super convenient for sbf who can now act like an idiot and explain this in a dumb way so people think they just dont understand even though its super simple
17131,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i hate when that happens
17132,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oh mama i lost my lolipop
17133,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,the more i read about this guys statements the more ashamed i am of all the industry big wigs that continue to support and also invested in this guy and his ilk also ashamed of our legal system that do not care about the billions stolen or the victims it cannot be as simple as oh its cuz he is rich he is not
17134,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,like when the changes in the super return you wrong almost equal
17135,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,how big is this guys sofa
17136,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,a zero here a zero there whats the big issue
17137,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,come on folks losing  billion is a simple mistake most of us do it on a daily basislol
17138,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,as the great father ted used to say the amazing thing about this case is that it’s not some amazingly complex fraud he just got customers to pay the money into ftx’s affiliated hedge fund…and then never transferred it from there into their ftx account 😂
17139,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,whoopsie
17140,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,that’s a bit much to miscalculate
17141,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,one two miss a few ninety nine eight billioni think thats his accounting process 
17142,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,off by about half a dozen zeroswhomst amongst with an mit education hasn’t fucked up so royally anyone s
17143,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,probably should have had an accounting department take care of that
17144,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,that’s too much to miscalculate
17145,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hopefully there is enough sufficient audit evidential matter to prove fraud on the face of it this has fraud written all over it where is the ex ceo of alameda she is flying way under the radar hopefully this will get constant media attention like enron sbf his parents carolyn her parents run with some powerful players i just dont see this snow ball getting smaller unless he completely covered the tracks and left no trace time will tell and this will be very interesting to follow for years to come i predict in  to  years he will be looking at  years in prison
17146,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,“don’t worry about how much it is just send it all over eventually we will dig ourselves out of the hole and we’ll be rich and the customers will be none the wiser”
17147,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,sbf misaccounted  billion  nothing happensretail investors misaccounted   irs knocks on ur door
17148,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,learn from sbf if you happen to steal large amount of money donate part to leading political party
17149,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,misaccounted   dollar maybe acceptable  but  billion hee a fraudulent scammer sheet

17153,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,there’s nothing wrong with spending money on luxury as long as it’s your own money there’s nothing wrong with admitting you are an idiot if you really are but this douchbag is not even doing that when i look at his cheat face and ellison i can’t find any reason to trust crypto exchanges they were simply over their heads and understandably that regulation is on the agenda you can’t have cheats like these spend and loose other peoples money like it didn’t matter
17154,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,id be okay with the death penalty for him scammers of this magnitude need to see an example made out of their fellow sociopaths
17155,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hes a pathological fxcking liar
17156,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,lol at how this guy thinks its all going to blow over if he says sorry enough
17157,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,hopefully he gets misplaced into a jail cell for about  years
17158,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,this pos is probably never going to see the inside of a prison cell
17159,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,dude i got written up for  as a grocery store cashier wtf
17160,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,why bother going to mit nowadays…

17166,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,this has to be satire
17167,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,and if i had misaccounted a small amount of my taxes the gov would fck me with no lube and expect me to say thanks
17168,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,me to irs ”i misaccounted the funds used for this years tax collection my bad y’all”
17169,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,this shit stops when capital punishment is applied in cases of this magnitude where hundreds of thousands lives are ruined for multiple generations
17170,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oopsiesoodle
17171,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i went to vegas recently and misaccounted several thousand dollars my friend had trusted me to hold onto for them  yeah that sounds better than im a degenerate who gambled someone elses money and lost it all
17172,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,poor guy so much work he was exausted s
17173,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,well at least he didnt blame it on the one armed man yet
17174,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,oopsie daisy silly old me😅
17175,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,apparently everyone doesnt know how to spell his last name eitherits bankmanfraud
17176,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20, what’s been going on with this i’ve been out of the loop
17177,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,yeah it happens to me all the time
17178,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,he should apply for a job at the congressional budget office he is overly qualified
17179,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,pfft dont worry bro happens to me all the time
17180,zb6szs,2022-12-03 03:47:20,i see he’s going for the idiot defense he’s trying to convince us it wasn’t fraud just plain incompetence
17547,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,happy to live simply take a fee for matching trades jesse powell ceo of kraken  source thats all my brokerexchange should do no more and no less
17548,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,a reason is they use their ftt tokens as collateral to borrow usd to pump their coin and invest in their backed projects
17549,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i knew i shouldnt trust someone with bankman in their name
17550,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, is so important fractional reserve works in traditional finance because we have savior of last  resort central banks governments we don’t have that in crypto we thought ftx was one of these saviors after what happened after the luna crash but it turned out they aren’t  ironic
17551,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx was a bad actor and its good it collapsed now and not in the future when it was even bigger with the result of a even bigger fallout
17552,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,finally a sane post on this subject people need to understand that cz did not destroyed ftx maybe he pushed it a bit  ftx destroyed themselves by commiting crimes and faking documents
17553,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx isnt a fucking bank    ftx and alameda acted like banks they werent insured they didnt have large reserves and no government is there to bail them out but they still printed money out of thin air only real banks could do that
17554,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam bankman crime sam bankman fried sam bankman tried sam bankman cried 
17555,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,what we can learn from this is the dex is the only way
17556,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i will sign a petition for the ceo to go to prison
17557,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,and the whole time sbf is out balling out of control and buying up everything he could get his hands on with your money
17558,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,but sam bankrunfraud said i’m going to get all my money back
17559,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,im no crypto expert but just read on wikipedia that ftx is incorporated in antigua and barbuda and headquartered in the bahamas this doesnt exactly inspire a lot of confidence in their corporate governance practices internal controls etc compared to companies registered in jurisdictions with more strict requirements im not saying this is the only issue to consider when choosing an exchange securities broker or any finacial intermediary but i always prefer one registered in the us eu etc
17560,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,but you know what  facts are boring and its more exciting for the morons of social media to say ftx was ‘brought down’ by a tweet and not years of financial mismanagement and improprietyand that sbf fortune was ‘wiped out’ nevermind the fortune was shares in an overvalued over leveraged house of cards
17561,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the fact people are turning on cz is mind boggling to me the earlier these ponzis collapse the better imagine if ftx had artificially inflated themselves to the point of overtaking binance we’d probably see btc at like  and the biggest black swan in crypto history
17562,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sbf even lied and said that have all customer assets available to withdrawal anytime he said that just two days ago
17563,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,call me naive but why is it so unfeasible for exchanges to simply make money from charging fees to buy fiat conduct trades  withdraw crypto  fiat  why do they need to overleverage themselves and gamble with our funds  there should be enough funds in an exchange so that if every user hit withdraw at the same time nobody would be left high and dry  is that naive of me is it just some deviant chasing of evenhigher profits coinbase must make a fortune off crypto cant they keep that safe for the lowvolume months  i dunno i dont like this chrissy wake up
17564,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, they used your own money to fck you this pretty much sums up almost every exchange
17565,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,
17566,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,important question though does binance do the same  their native token bnb is very very similar to what ftx has with ftt is there a cartwheel infinite money scheme on binance as well  are they also acting like a bank and using customer funds 
17567,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the crypto community as a whole are so deluded the only way this can be so is that most must be young adults teens this happens over and over again nothing changes and people bother to argue who did this or who did that and why its extraordinarily simple  theres this little thing called greed you may have heard of it  infact its the reason youre interested in crypto in the first place where there are no consequences laws greed will prevail look into the history of the last  years of crypto its scam after scam after rug after scam after collapse after scam after rug after scam after collapse and on and on wait until tether does a hold my beer
17568,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,they cant do anything ftx isnt even allowed in the usa they have no authority
17569,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx was doing what banks do crypto was created to destroy these entities crypto is doing its job
17570,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,if it’s too good to be true it usually is
17571,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so basically any big whale holding a cryptocurrency can ultimately tank that cryptocurrency whenever they feel like it cool
17572,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,giving binance  worth of ftt in the first place wasnt smart at all its insane how much leverage they have but they played their cards well
17573,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam bankman fried the next do kwoni can already visualize netflix creating a show of multiple seasons do kwon starring jackie chan sbf starring jonah hill and cz starring mike myers
17574,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,yeah nothing is original something already exist u just make it better with your own twist
17575,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,holy shit by some dumb luck i decided to withdraw all my funds from ftx literally one day before the crash
17576,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,one could see the ftx as the central banks of bitcoin as they hedge fiat currency and often run extra long cues of transactions if they fall or become one last single point of failure crypto is done for good
17577,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,and sam bankmanfraud is same guy who have friends all over the wallstreet goverment world economic forum and same guy was fucking with binance miss led people and press with cz and he tried to push centralized regulatory for crypto this kinda people should not do these things im reliefed he fell
17578,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,with all this happening with ftx why is reddit still pushing people to ftx if u go into ur vault and click gas fees it links u to ftx to open an account reddit you should remove that
17579,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,peeps with big mop heads cannot be trusted remember sideshow bob from the simpsonsi rest my case
17580,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,these are jailable offenses
17581,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,why do these crashes always happen midmonth when im two weeks away from my monthly dca
17582,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,are you not entertained
17583,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,tbh i mused to crypto not being trusted its been that way for over a decade and it is a transaction that does not involve projects such as bitcoin or ether
17584,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the true luna 
17585,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,going to be my investment thesis should i ever launch a fund
17586,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,this is probably just going to the void but…i’ve been using ftx as simply a portfolio tracker since the blockfolio days if ftx goes under i will probably need to find a new portfolio tracker huh any recommendations
17587,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,according to most crypto moonbois banks are the bad people which should be defeated with crypto big banks fucked up only  times in the last decade in crypto this happens on a monthly basis because a crypto exchange doesn’t do what it has to do  exchanging trades no it scams every penny out of you and then it declares bankruptcy afterwards
17588,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,thats not how that works yes you may use them as an exchange but they are effectively a brokeragethere is no way to offer traders leveraged products margin futures shortsales etc without fractionalizing the deposits ie customer deposits are not and could never be  to their balance sheet it wasnt necessarily a lie until there was a run on ftt they were solvent then ftt dropped significantly and as their largest asset they became insolvent as a result i dont think you understand what happened at enron thats not super important though the difference that matters the most for your argument is that ftt is a level  marktomarket asset this means there is an active and transparent market where identical assets are openly traded ie the fungibility of tokens at  they were more than solvent at  they are not as to point  thats market making its not always nefarious but i agree the conflict of interest never looks good see robinhood and citadel this is crypto my guy its not news that exchange tokens and leverage are dangerous and its not news that ftx was engaging heavily in both im certainly not defending ftx and im sure they will receive charges from at least the sec people are quick to claim they understand financial law or malintent without a shadow of a doubt im just trying to lay out reality
17589,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,they sold solana at the top which gave them the best balance sheet when everyone else was crushed
17590,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,crypto currencies are smoke and mirrors and have always been a foolhardy place to put real money
17591,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,why is everyone upset about this trashing cz and markets dumpingits insanethis was a good thing it outed a fraudulent player  brought more clarity to this world believe it or notnow is the time buy
17592,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i believe binance saved the day but a lot of people will not agree but not stepping in what would the consequences be today it’s so difficult for anyone off us to make a honest judgment because we still don’t know all the true facts and will we ever know
17593,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i agree with all this but why no jail for sbf
17594,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,it’s interesting to see all the crypto firms who couldn’t handle a bear market voyager celsius blockfi ftx etc
17595,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,and you know whats sad we wont learn shit from it and in the next bull run people will jizz themselves over institutions and this time its different nonsense we need regulations whenever we like it or not otherwise this shit will keep happening
17596,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,word of advice if an exchange is based in some random island or asian country theres a good chance theres always some shady shit going on believe it or not locations arent just memes
17597,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx  fuck that xchange
17598,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,everyone who thinks this dip is related to ftt or ftx selling their bitcoin don’t understand thisone of the largest and “safest” crypto exchanges especially for us  where majority of the money comes from  went illiquid  down in a shady waythe trust is gone all crypto bills are dead from a political view crypto just got reset by months and lost tons of trust that is why it’s dumping
17599,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx did some real dodgy shit and got comeuppance for it true maybe most people are just finding a scapegoat to vent their feelings for some catharsis
17600,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,none of that is a crime in an unregulated marketyou cant break a regulation that doesnt existcomparing a traditional heavily regulated market to an innovated but infantile and unregulated market is comparing apples to oranges
17601,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,does this really warrant the entire market getting tanked with it though
17602,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,thanks for posting this wish this was what everyone was focused on
17603,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,well it also depends on what exactly defines  backed assetsto me it sounded as if they backed stuff with their own token which had a certain value on paper which was severely inflated
17604,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,this might be dumb but i it’s killing me  what is cz
17605,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,guess they all are committing crimes welcome to crypto
17606,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i think it’s so wild stuff like this keeps happening and the community isn’t getting behind some much needed regulation enough with the “just move your coins to cold storage” argument trading platforms like binance need to and will exist and if they exist there needs to be some rules in place governing what those platforms are allowed to do with user funds the crypto space is going to be worlds ahead of where it is right now once that happens
17607,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,thanks to all your posts guys because of you i was able to pull my stuff out before everything colllapsedwas not that much but thanks
17608,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,do you have any sources i can check out
17609,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,didnt the ftx ceo just step down a month or  ago too maybe he was the cfo cant remember but he was a balding guy   people jumping ship before the crash maybe
17610,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sbf is too connected to do time unfortunately
17611,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,just look at the early history of… drum role please… banks all the parallels…
17612,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,this is what all brokers and crypto exchanges do
17613,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,wasnt ftx us set to buy voyager
17614,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i agree with this post cz did nothing wrong here although i do not trust any crypto exchange or third party to handle my money that dont offer fdic protection a bank run shouldnt affect a company that is supposed to cover all funds  this is absolutely a case of fraud and needs to be investigated but i doubt anyone is getting recourse in an unregulated market like crypto this is why theres so much negativity around this space its ripe for fraud and abuse and  regulations to prevent it from hurting ordinary people just investing
17615,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i know exchanges are all supposed to be bad but i feel like kraken is above the fray and regularly produces proof of fund audits change my mind
17616,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,leverage builds empires quickly and burns them down faster
17617,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,been at an event today wtf did i miss wasnt it yesterday that binance said they were buying ftx did that change
17618,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,buy crypto move to your own wallet it not hard people
17619,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,they were supposed to buy voyager so much for all that i hear robinhood is next
17620,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,realistically speaking fractional reserves shouldn’t be a thing anywhere banks or crypto people are inherently greedy by nature and abuse that power…case in point
17621,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,if this was  it would not have gone down well with the law…particularly around market manipulation…
17622,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i like how gensler and the sec are asleep at the wheel with respect to all the actual problematic issues in crypto that have a real affect on markets and american citizens meanwhile he is obsessed and laser focussed on battling ripple and giving coinbase a hard time when coinbase as a public company that has to open up its books  times a year is one of the exchanges that is least in need of scrutiny
17623,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the bankman is going to jail isn’t he
17624,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,agreed but saying that doesn’t stop the authorities from trying like they’ve donedoing in the past
17625,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,using their exchange token as collateral any exchange doing this will likely have the same fate
17626,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,just use kraken
17627,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i was able to transfer like  of my crypto out of ftx but still have like  in there since the cash isnt settled hoping to move it asap
17628,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,any exchange or bank dealing with fiat currencies is able to do shit like this because we need to trust them to basically send us the cash after we sent them our crypto it goes off chain it goes into the realm of unknowns that is why you should use onchain exchanges whereever possible to exchange cryptos and only send crypto to a centralized exchange when you actually want to withdraw fiat cexs are bridges with the fiat world i only have about  in my ftx account
17629,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,this is an essential remindersbf was still considered a model a month ago but we can see that it was lying like others and that this crypto winter is not forgiving to crooksunfortunately the victims are always the same customers who trust in the lies of these crooks
17630,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,its an unregulated market  i am not sure what people were expecting
17631,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the day i saw a fluff documentary on the vegan billionaire sam who wants to donate everything etc etc on nas i transferred everything away from ftx should have sold my ftt coin too but too late
17632,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,everything you say is true but your final conclusion is incorrect theyre collapsing because they were bad at itwhat on earth makes you believe any exchange  broker crypto or otherwise doesnt do what you just described you think binance is any better
17633,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the title alone is on fucking point fuck…amen scam bankman fraud is done
17634,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,coinbase will be next i have felt they have been having liquidity issues themselves and will not be surprised id they go down
17635,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx business model of acting like a hedgefund is what led to thisfoundation and premise of crypto is fine
17636,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,what a fucking ponzi scheme
17637,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,enjoy your moons
17638,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i still don’t know why people think the problem is cex though i still have full confidence in cex haven’t encountered any problems
17639,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx isnt a fucking bank they arent supposed to have fractional reserves hate to break it to you bud but other exchanges are more than likely doing the same  just saying 
17640,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,all they have is fractional reserve “fuck you’s”
17641,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i doubt that sec would look into someone that was working properly
17642,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,death to sbf
17643,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,holy shit man with fuckers like these the majority of people wont get into crypto because they are too fucking scared
17644,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,very true
17645,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, is false because they are completely allowed to do that theres  regulations against it and its in the disclaimer every customer of an exchange accepts as terms of use not your keys not your coinsthis really shouldnt be a surprise to anyone to know that exchanges can and will rehypothicate your funds its legal the crimes were committed in the order books and alameda loans
17646,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,nailed it
17647,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,cz is the goat
17648,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam the scams role in the hack of grim finance should be investigated
17649,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,absolutely they will fail and taking sol with them
17650,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, comment
17651,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,it’s also important to note that ftxus is separate from ftx   sbf refused to sell ftxus with ftx thereby dooming ftx because he didn’t want to lose everything personally at a firesale   also sbf transferrred millions out using a wbtc transaction   anothe cool thing because of blockchain we all could see it
17652,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,like martin shkreli told do kwon prison aint so badgood luck friedman
17653,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,why are people madsurprised    same thing happened to voyager
17654,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,it was a planned fraud from the start  they said what people wanted to hear   very obviously a ponzi scheme but greedy people ignored it   if people ppl were stupid enough to give their money to the derelict looking mf sam and his gf then they deserve it
17655,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so did they or didnt they launder money for the democrats through ukraine anyone have any insight
17656,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,crypto is a scam
17657,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,all true so what should ftx customers do now surely not just move to the next exchange and trust them they will be better right
17658,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,you realize this is true for most exchanges including stock brokerages  when gme fiasco happened they had to stop trading because many brokerages didn’t have enough collateral to meet the obligations related to derivatesi am not defending ftx but i can guarantee you that most exchanges would collapse if there is a total bankrun like what happend to ftx stock brokerage collapses are rare because of strict regulations and sipc
17659,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,who  is accusing cz of making ftx ftt collapsing  i really feel like i need screenshot of people or somebody relevant and not a mindless douche saying this kind of thingsftx is going down cos infinite money machine same as always
17660,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,they arnt allowed to lend out your assets yes they are  you agreed to let them do so when you signed up  they existed in the crypto space where totally understanding what youre getting into is  on you
17661,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, they cant pay back customers  they became insolvent legally its not illegal to become insolvent  they inflated their bs  if they were being audited under law then they cant do this since they werent and everyone knew about this then it really doesnt matter this auditing bullst got to stop nothing in crypto is audited thoroughly maybe usdc but then it doesnt make sense because you can exchange that usdc for some shady unbacked cryoto too we dont talk about financial audit  they traded against their customers nothing proven yet they are in business of selling shovels they wont dig themselves exchange fees is the business they are more interested in keep it fair again its not proven that they traded against their customers
17662,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ah a crypto crime has been committed eh if people would simply understand to not keep coin on these exchanges the world would be a better place people who clearly do not understand the necessity of defi will continue to lose money people who continue to leave money on exchanges will continue to lose money how many times must we say “not your keys not your wallet” we need an understanding and education we can blame everyone else for our failure to act believe me i feel for those who have lost money please educate yourselves until regulations come i know that’s not defi it will continue to be a shit show you simply can’t trust these people and i fail to understand why people keep their money in the exchanges it makes no sense to me remove your shit from these types of exchanges period
17663,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,remember guys not your keys not your crypto you should be using mobile walletsdesktop wallets or ledgers to store your crypto exchanges can go bust but if you store you crypto in your own vaults your always protected
17664,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,tether should fall next if they are doing something shady
17665,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ultimately you can claim that the fact crypto is crashing because of the vague and ominous shorts with a very biased and hopeful view due to your current red portfolioor you can realise the true state of the matter and the matter is that crypto markets have been trading on nothing but algorithmic guesswork and insane levels of extended leverage for a lengthy spell of time that time has come to an end broader macroeconomics will destroy many crypto projects and spaces over the upcoming recession and many will not return it is currently unclear to me that even without the current climate crypto markets were in a healthy position to begin withim a fan of the projects and everything they stand for but ultimately currently it is a wild west market and the wild west doesnt fare favorably under modern world turmoil as shown countless times before the time for speculation assets are over or at best halted without an upcoming restart date get out now bite the loss and be grateful you atleast kept some of your funds further down the line a version of crypto unlike today will exist in the future but that time is not now in my heart of hearts i believe in the ethos of cryptocurrency and the offspring it has created but its over and it has been for a while money to be made in the near future for speculative gamblers but not for lengthy holds
17666,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,will the democrats give the  million in stolen funds donation sam recently gave them back  i doubt it as they are scumbags
17667,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,there is no evidence to say ftx stole funds or inflated their balance sheet the problem with getting this part wrong is that you leave yourself open to it happening again in the future you need to get it right so you can avoid it from happening again ftx played money games with customer funds this is different from stealing what you want is a custodian to leave your funds alone of course you don’t want them stolen but you also do not want the custodian to use your funds for other things do you see the nuanceftx based its valuation on trust meaning users had to trust that ftt had value the problem is that when people started losing value in ftt ftx started to fail you can avoid all this in the future if you demand your custodian not keep all their reserves in unbacked tokens also ftt was supposed to do some good in the world but was really only used to extract value from users users didn’t really seem to care all they cared about was that the price went up the problem with that is that when prices move up high based on feelings they fall down low based on feelings people need to trade value not feelings i’ve never used ftx i’m not for or against i’m just trying to make clear the nuance you’d need to avoid this same thing from happening again in the future
17668,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,cz saw these weaknesses when he acted he went in and got what he wanted he is a very smart scary and dangerous guy and he destroyed us all along the way however i cant help but admire the beautity of his plans execution
17669,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,independent of whether ftx committed a crime cz chose to join them and also become a criminalgreat way to kill  exchanges in one day well done
17670,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,do we believe binance doesnt do what ftx was doing
17671,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sounds like you are butt hurt because you lost money but you were irresponsible by leaving your funds on an exchange not your keys not your crypto gotta be smarter and more responsible man
17672,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,not your keys not your crypto if you lost money on this it’s your own fault people
17673,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,imagine thinking every single exchange  is not doing the exact same shit lolapart from coinbase since they are public
17674,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,fraud at this level should come with the death penalty but nothing will happen to him
17675,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ok first of all ftx didn’t do shit alameda did secondly there is not a single shred of proof that ftx doesn’t maintain customer assets  if you honestly think that binance or any other exchange doesn’t trade against customers then you are delusionalis some bad shit happening yes but why don’t we wait for some fucking proof before you make such ludicrously bold claims that you can’t back up in the fucking slightest
17676,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,you cant be mad when someone puts you down after they catch you doing shady business its a dog eats dog world
17677,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,it looks like social media celebrities are not active today to disseminate their little knowledge i guess they busy trying to withdraw funds from exchanges hard to find reliable information today my usual sources ie twitter and youtube and reddit
17678,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sbf was happy that he had found an infinite money glitch
17679,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i didnt know about number  any proof or article about it
17680,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam bankman got fried
17681,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,that’s on point op only post anyone should read about this subject
17682,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,really wondering if other exchanges are doing the same probably but i hope not ill get my coin off all the exchanges
17683,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,every post for the last month related to ftx i say sbf is a fuckin  snake i wouldnt doubt before very long youll come to find out that hes a part of every other screwed up scheme that has happened in the last  months hes got his hands in the honey pot man ive been saying this for months he was a pos when he was an armchurch trader and he wasnt that great at that got lucky all hes good at doing is ripping people off and stealing their money hes not playing with his moneyhes playing with our money thats the messed up part i really hope him and do kwon  both end up in jail they could be the perfect couple
17684,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,have people been defending ftx i must have missed those posts or comments but i’m guessing their absurd marketing budget had to go somewhere their collapse made the front page of rnba
17685,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,can someone  what exactly is going on with the whole ordeal i’ve been trying to piece together information from  different articles this all started with a tweet from cz
17686,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,either way it puts a bad taste for investors to jump into crypto with all these shenanigans going on
17687,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i guess crime doesnt pay or no it definitely did and they got away with it for too long and will suffer minorly compared to customers
17688,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,you can be an exchange that makes tens of millions by taxing tradesorgamble customer money and lose
17689,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, is absolutely false any entity that offers leverage trades and derivative products by definition is not going to have  with deposits now they also did  and  we have no concrete data on but let’s at least understand the situation accurately the wild alameda trades are enough to blow it up
17690,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,shill bitchcoin fail
17691,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ah yes this is the reason why dex is better
17692,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,blockfolio was a better project
17693,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,since you could trade derivatives on ftx it was possible to lose more money than you actually had because of this fact even if all funds were  backed at time a it would still be possible for them to be bankrupt at time bnow ftx had risk management systems that would liquidate users before they lost too much money but if the only thing that happened here was that their risk management failed then thats hardly a crime and only incompetence or laziness or something like thatthe rumour of course is that alamedas account was nonliquidatable and their massive losses on ftt caused both to collapse but that in itself probably isnt a crime either
17694,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,cz good sbf bad cc subreddit as usual are full of maxis trying to fud cz and bnb but all they do is miss out on the best performing crypto since 
17695,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i would say crimes are bad business tho
17696,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx arena to be renamed to binance arena
17697,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,true but everyone cool guys love hating on binance

17708,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,finally someone had to say it
17709,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,its not funny and i hope he gets arrested as well as caroline these ppl belong in prison its not okay to do shit kinda thing a lot more damage was caused compare to regular violent crime time to stop playing nice bc there rich lock them tf up

17711,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam doesnt have to worry about jail  i imagine someone who lost millions of dollars will take care of him soon
17712,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,wow trashpretty much what every commercial bank does nowadays loli thought crypto was supposed to stray away from traditional finance and into decentralized finance
17713,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,well said
17714,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,not one statement here is proof of any crimes jumping to conclusions won’t solve anything
17715,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,when centralized exchanges are controlled by clowns 😔
17716,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,it’s collapsing because they were idiots and did shady ass shit did cz accelerate their collapse probably but they were doomed anyways
17717,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,just tell me if i have to commit suicide or not
17718,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,crimes you say the same crimes that can land you in jailor is this typical rcryptocurrency talk of their kangaroo courts
17719,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,crypto market knows how to filter out bad actors itself
17720,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,arent all exchanges like this though

17724,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam bankmanfried literally named after bankers
17725,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,he had bankman in his name the warning sign was in plain sight 🥸
17726,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,is there a law that says they have to keep customer funds  or thats just what they said they would do with crypto being unregulated i would be surprised if there is a law about this
17727,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,surprise surprise surprise sargent carter
17728,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so the folks who had crypto in voyager bought out by ftx will now go to binance  or lose it all
17729,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sounds like quicksand
17730,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,which bank could pay out all their customers at the same time
17731,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,all of this kind of shitgreed fucks up what we all want for a digital currency future
17732,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the last ep of scam economy covers the crimeing pretty well
17733,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,feature not a bug of lack of regulation
17734,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,shit like this and i  regulated cex banks fuck too but at least not like this and government is there too ultimately you need someone accountable i am not saying banks are saints but this here from a top exchange is fucking crime  user friendly and effective dex most of them are just bad in terms of user experience compared to binance or kraken
17735,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the most interesting part will be to see how the retail customer funds are treated  it may well be worth the cost of wrapping your coinbase  and selling it to get out of centralization  shanghai withdrawals can’t come soon enough
17736,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,well said op guess we just have to hear these hard facts  crypto  market is cleaning house
17737,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,how do you think they grew as fast as they did of course they cut corners the guy is a fraud just like the others risking everything to ”win fuck the greedy scumbags
17738,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,all these exchanges ripping their customers apartive took out all my funds and moved them to an external wallet you should too
17739,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,while you are not wrong and i agree… i do want to correct your point number  they are allowed to do whatever they want to do within reason so long as you agree to it in the terms of service welcome to the world of nonregulation
17740,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,the part i dont quite understand  why was sbf pushing so hard for regulation
17741,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx isnt a fucking bank they arent supposed to have fractional reserveseh why so isnt this how all centralized exchanges operate including stock brokersif you want your assets decentralized then just do it crypto stocks etc
17742,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,hopefully sbf will be held personally liable and ordered to give up all his assets
17743,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,celsius users first time
17744,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,honestly probably didnt break any laws they are based in the bahamas
17745,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,as this all starts to come out into the open i’m telling myself the pain we are seeing in the market now is a good thing in the long run if things are really as bad as the reports starting to come out about ftx’s are saying then the sooner the company and everyone involved in the decisions to  engage in fractional reserve lending with client funds are held to account the better
17746,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,they traded against their customersi guess it was easy to liquidate leveraged short or long positions and get easy money so they could technically play that zero sum game
17747,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,any cex lack proper regulation and controls and is shady af defi is also risky as hell but at least its much more transparent
17748,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,shame on you sbf
17749,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,if they announced the deal wont go through they would take another blow which it sounds like they cant afford well see i guess
17750,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,what will be the next cex to fail right answers only
17751,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sbf math wiz son of stanford law professors he studied at the best universities worked his way up and in a short time became one of the biggest rat fucked assholes in financial histories good sense and ethics are so much more than your zip code
17752,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sbf has been a pos for months publicly
17753,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,truths spoken
17754,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i for one am glad that we are cleaning the house during bullrun all of the scammy mess may go and we will rise even stronger
17755,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,can we get back the normal blockfolio app to track crypto portfolio without all the other crap
17756,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,no  straight to the court  private liability
17757,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sec on the case  jailtime incomingwhich other exchange is next  maybe another one who sponsors sports stadiums and pays ridiculous interest and is backed by a scam token
17758,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,😪
17759,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i think most of the exchanges are fractional reserving it
17760,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,doesn’t fidelity and vanguard do the same lol
17761,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,a non binding loi is not a deal  this is unlikely the last shoe to drop
17762,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,this is a bigger mess than enron  some people will probably be given lengthy prison sentences
17763,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so they took the late  early  bank model in the us and ran with it on the international more unregulated markets ouch
17764,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sounds like brokers on wall street
17765,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,apparently cz only accelerated the inevitable i feel sorry for people losing their funds on the other hand the sooner all those scammy zombies and criminal projectexchanges die the sooner we can start a sustainable recoverygreat chance for honest projects and businesses in the long termand i agree people like sbf mashinsky richard heart etc belong in jail since they are criminals
17766,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i cant wait until all these fradulentmade up gains are wiped out and the crypto bros have to actually contribute something valuable to society
17767,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,papers cant cover fire eventually it will burn itself just a little sparks
17768,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,wow this jackass painted himself as some kind of benevolent philanthropist vegan billionaire who barely sleeps cause he works so hard and turns out hes massive criminal on par with kenneth lay and bernie madoff
17769,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,man this market is cleaning house any exchanges that are less than dependable are getting swept away
17770,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so if i have money in ftx i’m going to lose it all
17771,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,ftx run out of liquidity
17772,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i love times like these
17773,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,where is the daily thread link
17774,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,having no regulations  of the time only benefits people and companies like ftxalmost like regulations were there to protect investors
17775,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i repeat fuck scam bagman friedchickenshit
17776,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,im not sorry for ftx but i really feel anxious for customers its not their fault and they will suffer

17780,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,does anyone know the extent of sbf’s fraud even on a personal level i feel like more will come out but idk his story of arbitraging btc in  always seemed sus to me and if it was as simple as he said the arbitrage would’ve been diminished by people who were ogs in the space i wasn’t paying much attention to crypto at the time so someone can comment if his story kinda checks out just always sounded sus to me and like something he came up with after the fact
17781,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,sam bankman living up to his last name…  fried get it
17782,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so was this somehow related to why he was pushing so hard for some plan in the celsius fiasco was he going to use our debt to balance out the coffers for ftx and let us keep the change 🙄
17783,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,if all tokens ran on a smart contract platform like etherum or neo or tezos whichever then we wouldnt need a cex the issues forced upon us wouldnt have happened
17784,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i knew that guy was a fuckup when i read elons txts
17785,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,hang on now crypto is an unregulated space im not disputing a crime may have been commited but lets be honest here the lack of regulation is causing greedy players to exploit us i was anti regulation last year but after celsius and now ftx i am very pro regulation
17786,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,i’m just happy fortune cookies will stop telling me to fuckin buy crypto from them
17787,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,do kwon is out there feeling relieved that the pressure is off him for  minuteswe should start a crypto hunt token which funds the bounty hunting of bad actors within crypto most wanted list
17788,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,and they will get away with it
17789,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,but its not so doesnt matter and exactly why this keeps happening but you can bet this is more fuel to try and push regulation even faster
17790,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,how many of these thing need to collapse before people accept this is a trendit doesnt matter how big the thing is when things get tough someone if running off with the billions of dollars with out rules and regulationyou cant just keep sayingeverything is fine you are dumb for using that exchange
17791,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,so did tom brady know
17792,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,wow sbf deserves to be in the same category as  and luna founders
17793,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,as ive said on every ftx post he called it a ponzi scheme how could you trust anything sam was apart of its your own fault
17794,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,crypto industry has been taking a lot of black eyes lately
17795,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,literally what i was thinkingif they would have simply stuck to profiting from the fees off of trades they wouldnt have gotten here
17796,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,human greed how do you control that when its decentralized and unregulated
17797,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45, digits eth tonight
17798,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,scam bagman fraud is a criminal pos in a just world jail would be the next stop for him
17799,yqikm9,2022-11-09 13:09:45,okay but how does all this affect ftx us same business owner means potentially the same risks but the site is run in a more regulated country so does that mean these tricks werent being done inside ftx usconfused as to whether this is entirely separate or just another domino farther down the chain
18115,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its a shitty business going under do people really think this is btcs fault
18116,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,failure of sbf the only failure on his part is not getting more money out of it than he did this wasn’t an “oops” it was intentional

18126,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,interesting because i think ftx was a donor of his
18127,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,he is not wrong last i checked btc is still humming along exactly as intended

18135,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,good to see at least one member of govt understand its not a crypto issue but an issue of fraud
18136,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,the lack of regulation didnt just make ftx possible it made it inevitable
18137,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,so when exactly will they be held accountable for their corruption when will gary gensler be removed from his position being that everyone knows he’s been compromised and he’s court
18138,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,tom emmer is a fucking piece of shit
18139,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,gotta say i love the copium going on in this sub every time people lose their life savings after investing in crypto it is never crypto’s fault 🤣
18140,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,gary gensler is a total fraudhe is most destructive deceptive and corrupt politician in the world
18141,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,gensler should be fired like months ago his sole job is to protect investors and provide clarity to a space thats been begging for it meanwhile driving innovation away he makes it harder for investors to become accredited in the name of protecting us he is another corrupt 
18142,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,imagine being so disappointing that someone other than your parents call you a failure
18143,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,we just get fud while real bankers get to load up on btc
18144,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,such a right thing to say right now man we are good with the fact that tom emmer is being real right now he is being just like one of us and thats just a good thing
18145,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,so refreshing to hear such spoton rhetoric about crypto from a congressman
18146,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,wow he’s actually on point here good job 👍 hopefully everyone will be accounted including the oversight from the regulators this is why decentralization is key it avoids corruption from people like ftx
18147,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,tldr us congressman tom emmer called out former ftx ceo sam bankmanfried and sec chair gary gensler for the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange this is not just a failure of ftx emmer said its not about the crypto industry this is about regulators and regulators he addedthis summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article as always dyor
18148,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,ahh yes crypto genius minnesota rep tom emmer
18149,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,woah he gets it can we have him as a senator cause they seem to not get it for the most part…
18150,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48, decentralized finance is not what its about its not about the crypto industry this is about sam bankmanfried and regulatorsim kinda impressed a politician said this
18151,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,it’s fraud
18152,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its not a failure of crypto rather failure of greed
18153,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,that’s why you need to get your coins of the cex and other centralized finance
18154,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,wait a minutedid i justagree with someone in the us government

18162,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,emmer is a homophobic asshole but is right about crypto
18163,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its about time we heard more of this a lot of media outlets are choosing to blame crypto and investors which is hard to believe

18171,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,finally someone speaking the truth human cause these issues decentralization cuts that from the equation and solves the problem
18172,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,finally some real sense

18180,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its a failure of the crypto community the whole point of bitcoin is that something like this should not be possible but ideals of dont trust verify go quickly out of the window if a bit of wishful thinking can create a ton of money for a short amount of time
18181,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its a failure of regulations we need some healthy regulations like yesterday

18185,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,centralized yet no regulation huh thats a new one
18186,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,tom is right hope he and other lawmakers will hold these ftx scammers accountable
18187,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,good statement not a good politician
18188,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,if we don’t throw sam in jail immediately then yes people will assume crypto is all a scam
18189,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,nothing is ever cryptos fault but it is traditional finances fault when companies there go under rightdouble standard is amazing
18190,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,centralizing a decentralized currency what could go wrong
18191,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,he is right
18192,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,yeah
18193,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,people be ponze scheming nothing new here buncha people lost money sbf probably won’t see a jail cell and we move on till the next asshole does a ponze scheme
18194,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,💯
18195,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,is this guy saying that the only thing that sbf did wrong was get caught so what is that guy in charge of again because those counts will be off
18196,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,he actually did it the mad lad did it
18197,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,dexs can prevent this i trust algorithms more than humans tbh
18198,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,this will continue to happen without frequent audits we would get fried at my institution for doing what ftx has done
18199,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,this will keep happening as long as its not regulated i guarantee there is so much shady shit going on that we will never know
18200,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,amen
18201,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its not so much that it crashed is a failure of crypto but the fact that so many people bought into it to begin with is an issue with the crypto community as a whole
18202,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,and dumbasses here still think regulation is a bad idea
18203,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,for real  dont keep your hard earned crypto in exchanges  get a full core wallet and run a node or get a lightweight wallet and xfer when you need to make a transaction
18204,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,and tom voted no on transparency  they are all in on it
18205,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,absolutely agree with this ftx is not to do with crypto as a core form of currency sbf is just a badly organised and turns out bad person too
18206,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,this wont be a crypto winter unlike the  crash there are way more people with big checks just swarming around waiting to pounce not gonna call a price but its going to be much higher in a years time
18207,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaexactly what we expected them to be saying in order to have a singular bank managing all the crypto out there   they want to own woops i mean regulate the crypto market
18208,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,heres a fresh take centralization fucks everybody use a dex and lets all stfu about ftx and other centralized garbage
18209,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,totally right fire gensler voyagers celsius ftx all bankrupt on his watch
18210,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,the logic is good right now man we can say that a lot of time because that is just the reality and we all know that shit right now we are good with this
18211,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,gotta say that he is right in this case and most of us cant deny that tom emmer is being right and thats the only reason why i am supporting this guy right now
18212,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its wasnt a failure it was a crime
18213,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,we know the reality and thats just going around right now we all can say that and thats just the reality its not a crypto currency failure and i can agree over that
18214,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,well put
18215,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,well then how come my crypto portfolio has shat the bed as a result
18216,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,damn straight  exact result of centralization
18217,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,ftx doesn’t appear to be a failure of any kind looks more like a successful ponzi scheme without regulation of exchanges this will happen over and over again without exchanges crypto will not survive
18218,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,how does an everyday investor get bitcoin if they cant access one of these centralized exchanges you cant mine bitcoin from home anymore
18219,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,finally some common sense
18220,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,can we direct some of this uproar at mashinsky and celsiusif sbf siphons off all the hate thats just further salt in the wound for unfortunates like myself who lost a ton in the celisus scam
18221,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,that was amazing ser thank you for fighting for the good actors in the crypto space
18222,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,finally someone calling it for what it is it’s a shame a handful of people got to tarnish it for everyone
18223,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,the problem is centralization with no restrictions in place and regulation not your keys not your crypto let this be a lesson only buy what you understand
18224,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,nope just a piece of shit failure
18225,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,i remember the filing mentioned  owners why is sbf is the only one talked about is the other guy so low profile or just be in a wrong place at the wrong time
18226,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,first server side has to cost it sadly i’ve learned what hits hardest just at the final tide decentralization for services is expensive af and no one has figured out how to automate and pay for it that’s the real truth
18227,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its a failure of people how many times must exchanges fail before people learn
18228,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,then how do you turn cryptocurrency into something that you can use to buy things
18229,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,tldr sbf tried to get the congress to pass special treatment legislation that would replace central clearing in commodities with a model based liquidations and failed only because  the cme threatened to sue
18230,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,tom emmer also believes trump won the  election so
18231,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,amazing work tomlet’s do an interview on my channel to discuss this further
18232,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,failure is not a last step its a one step where we learn from that step
18233,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,this is just good that we are seeing this right now man
18234,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,a sound of reason buried in the doom and gloom
18235,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,just going to say that he is being right tom emmer is saying some right shit because this is just what going around and we can trust these shits for real man

18238,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,support emmer and his attempt to take down sbf and gary gensler

18240,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,once again this is financial fraud and a failure of the us government

18245,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,this is going good and he is saying the right thing and most of us are going to think like this because this is just something real to most of us right now we know that
18246,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,its just a single iteration of a project their adoption was a failure like anchoring protocol luna
18247,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,tom emmer the goat

18254,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,the only difference between this and the  collapse is the tax payer bailout  corruption and greed is a human problem not a tech problem
18255,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,then jail his arse 😳
18256,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,so hes repeating the jp morgan line about crypto

18264,z2gp1o,2022-11-23 05:41:48,senator what is clear to thousands of harmed investors in the us is that no one is launching an investigation into ethgate attorney john deaton has all the indisputable facts laid out in an easy to read timeline sec corruption is real

18619,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this is going down in the history books for sure
18620,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,
18621,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he meant to type “twat” cuz that’s what he is

18630,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,hes communicating with someone using some type of codethats literally the only thing that makes sense
18631,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ultimately this is the reckoning crypto needed open source and decentralization is what crypto is supposed to be all about and the only way forward
18632,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it seems like “crypto” was a digital social idea introduced to both speed up and highlight human greed corruption and moral failures on a massive scale working as intended
18633,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what a timeline to be living in…
18634,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,buy a rig farm your self or buy crypto and put it in your safe wallet and by the gods make sure you actually buy a crypto thats been out for years like bitcoin  im sure im not the only one who noticed all the ruggpulls and bs the last years from pornstars trying to make a quick buck and random celebs  the luna bs and now this stop throwing all your money at new projects thats supposed to be the next new shit it usualy isnt throw in some you can lose and treat it as lottery you dont throw in all your savings at the lottery do you why the fuk would you do that to some random shit a kid made in a basement sure some crypto projects do great and you can earn alot but if you go by  you got a higher chance of failing just like the lottery so stop fuking around with your life savings thinking you get super rich insta  buy some bitcoin or a old coin thats proven it can last and got a good profit sit down open wallet in  years and cash out a good profit be happy
18635,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this pushes the decentralization narrative
18636,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what he meant was i fked u and you cant do anything about it
18637,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,treat your centralized exchanges like a visit to your dentist go in do whats needed to be done be gonecustodians can absolutely f you over crypto is about selfcustody if thats not appealing to you then traditional finance is much saferi wonder how many more mt goxs or ftxs are needed before this is understood the irreversibility of crypto definitely can definitely be exploited by bad actors
18638,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,watching you guys pretend you understand this  market is a hoot
18639,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,theranos was pretty huge as well what makes ftx so bad is they had no reason to leverage or take client funds they were already printing money
18640,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,how do crypto investors keep forgetting rule  over and over and over and over again
18641,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,is this the guy engaging in orgies dang money can buy anything lol
18642,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,abbott and costello perhaps  even in the absence of regulation in response to this itll sting there will be a trial if not multiple over this and its going to drag everything through the mud this could end up being the cryptocurrency version of theranos
18643,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,bro about to reveal his seed phrase
18644,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,can anyone summarize the difference between what went wrong woth luna and do kwon and what went wrong with ftx and sbf
18645,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,they say it’s just rumors for now but the pieces seem to fit closer to a financing of casual investments turned south as some companies do money can cover any transactions but if the buyer doesn’t want to buy they’re going to drive the market themselves
18646,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,shouldn’t this influencer be held accountable what does everyone think to be fair we all fell for this ponzi and thought it was legit
18647,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,hard to take the apology seriously when he built a secret back door…the mere fact it’s secret means he knew what he was doing was wrong as opposed to just making poor investments
18648,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the way i see it its  of users money thats not small change
18649,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,after hearing sbfs voice for the first time i can now see why he failed so epically
18650,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,my god when i say i gasped when i heard his voice the first time
18651,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sadly these types of criminals almost never see prison unless they steal from the wrong person
18652,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he said hed spell out what happened so far hes doing so
18653,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this scammer is totally off shape looking like a castrated pig
18654,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,who do exchanges hold assets on other exchangesthis is like me asking my friends to store my cash in their wallet  even though i have a perfectly good wallet in my pocket
18655,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,humans have become the dumbest species on the planet
18656,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,watching this leftist fraud  who is the progeny of other leftist frauds  crash and burn is so utterly delicious
18657,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,previous “scammers” still have followers and some people still believe them won’t surprise me if sbf still holds a fan base no matter how much he fks up
18658,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ftx basically got margin called and liquidated because their crypto mainly luna and ftt died
18659,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,here for the tech
18660,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, h

18664,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,incorrect he followed that up with ‘h’
18665,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it was all a scam
18666,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,imagine hes trying to fake his death with a tweet
18667,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,whatwhat do you mean your upset that i stole your life savings 😡
18668,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,my guess is he took drugs to cope with this stuff wherever he is holed up or he is actually a bot that went rouge
18669,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,hes a clown im not surprised
18670,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,disregard exchanges acquire moons
18671,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,binance is the last place i would trade or store money you’ve been warnedi would buy usdt bonds from bernie madoff before i opened a binance account
18672,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he is trying to impersonate kwon
18673,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what what in the butt
18674,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, should be a small drop in the bucket for them doesnt seem impactful at all
18675,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,lol fuckin fraud giving away to political parties and donating to “charities” like ukraine
18676,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,loli love when they put tech bros in from of laptops so they can speed fake code

18678,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,thankfully our gop leaders will get right on this and actually do something for onceany second now
18679,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,if you want to store your crypto off exchanges but cant get a hardware wallet and are afraid of hot wallets you could always use a mobile wallet then after writing down the seed phrase and storing your crypto just delete the app from your phone use the public address to keep storing more crypto on it and check it using the public address with website like etherescan then if you want to move crypto off it just put in the seed phrase and delete the app when you are done
18680,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,throughout history effeminate inept feeble and weak males like sbf would not outlive their teenage years…and that naturally weeded humanity from its waste… but no longer…
18681,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he definitely donated  but it wasnt to charity nor his money
18682,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the most troubling to come out of this entire debacle is that fact that the sec was an accomplice to all of this  who else can anyone trust in this corrupted financial system
18683,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,yah but the landscape of today is much different companies throwing around billions and billions of dollars and tanking and gambling and greedy  i feel like capitalism has hit a truly “late stage” sort of vibe over the last  years
18684,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i thought he was detained
18685,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,no proof yet and btw we’re still waiting to see all that proof from the election  big lie y’all are way behind
18686,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so when some said a few months ago that what was happening in ukraine was money laundering a conspiracy theorist was called  the theory appears to be true as are all the other conspiracy theories which have been shown to be an absolute truth
18687,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,“who”
18688,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,maybe in response to the death rumor
18689,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this ftx shit just keeps getting crazier and crazier the more i learn have they even caught the fucker yet either
18690,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,truly a very mature ceos
18691,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,perhaps hes trying to tell us the cause is a what and not a who what do i know
18692,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what’s next
18693,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, da fuq
18694,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i’m surprised he is still going on twitter instead of laying lowbut they never lie low
18695,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,im so pissed
18696,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,wallet get and use a wallet
18697,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so thats what unregulated crypto meanshmm
18698,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,its going to be part of his defense your honor our client clearly doesnt understand technology and found himself atop a company that he had no right to be running through a series of unfortunate events he tried to quit quietly as evidenced by his routine trips out of the office refusing to work with those who did understand the technology and taking it as serious as he did in these pictures while they proceed to show the court pictures of sbf in his normal attire and uncombed hairhes going to claim immense ineptitude because hes been dressing the part for years
18699,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,is it because he got handcuffed before he could finish the tweet
18700,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,annnd its gone
18701,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ftx is the biggest collapse of a corporation since  would imply ftx was valued as a companywhich it absolutely wasnt
18702,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,now binance has to go for the final nail in the cryptocoffin 🙃
18703,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this whole ftx just about sums america right up tons of money with idiots at the helm
18704,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he hasn’t been the ceo since last friday…so technically no the ceo of ftx didn’t make that tweet but the former ceo did
18705,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,don’t use ftx they said since  but you still did didn’t you
18706,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, evergrande anyone
18707,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this is exactly what the government wants to happen so they can regulate crypto into the ground it’s not a crypto problem it’s a dont keep your shit on exchanges you stupid stupid poops
18708,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,gee where are all the people who say mt gox was in the early days or only small unknown exchanges exit scam at now they seemed confident that big exchanges cant possibly lose their money learn from history or be doomed to repeat it
18709,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,dex  cexpeople will learn  eventually
18710,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,use cold storage exchanges are just unregulated banks with a shorter shelf life
18711,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,it was only  years old run by this knucklehead weirdo the fried bankman right from the start was the whole ftx thing not a setup to  demand the government regulate crypto  funnel tens of millions of dollars back to democrat campaigns
18712,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,   acan anyone make a rhyme on this does he really mean ha like hahaha
18713,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,let me guess it was an accident it was sent there in the first place
18714,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i will die of old age waiting for a single one of you to post any evidence that ukraine gave money to ftx theres no source for this fabricated twitter rumor and no voluntary crypto contributions do not count as us aid
18715,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the craziest cex ceo i begin musk
18716,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,is sbf going to jail or what
18717,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so he basically did what the us government does take money from the working class to line the pockets of politicians
18718,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,twitter hold my beer
18719,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,at least after the tulip markets crash you have pretty flowers to look at tho

18721,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so whats going to happen to sbf is jail a possibility
18722,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,getting rich with crypto is like that arcade game where the light spins around in a circle and you gotta hit it at the exact right moment to win except its really fucking hard and probably rigged besides
18723,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,no matter how many people get scammed in crypto there is another wave of suckers right behind believing they can get rich quick it’s a never ending flow of easy marks
18724,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,crypto survived mt gox sam will just be a footnotethanks to him i can buy at firesale prices
18725,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the democrats idea run this country to the hell now we know where they get the money to give lol
18726,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,watch for him enjoying his flight back to israel
18727,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,they were also donating stolen funds to democrats and apparently donations to ukraine went through the exchange lol classic money laundering his parents are not some randos either
18728,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,id also like to know who the dark money is that poured billions into the republican party
18729,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,crypto markets will never be the same like this wasnt said every bear market than  years later ath again lol

18731,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,the funny thing is that i made a post about cexs being an issue about a year ago it got very little notice or response but the few who did reply seemed to understand the issue i posted more about kyc issues which have arisen with ftx but them stealing all your crypto is obviously another huge issue
18732,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,because he is  years old who had massive success it’s not like he runs a family business that was inherited for generations
18733,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this is all part of the plan for the great reset and the implementation of cbdc they needed this kind of failure in crypto to force their hamd
18734,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sam unbanking friends
18735,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,why would someone who already had billions even need to steal money theres gotta be more to this story
18736,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what kind ftx is different than mtgox stupid people always do their mistakes twice and then infinitelycryptocurrency is not an entity designed to be exchanged either via cexes or dexesall the exchanges are secondary entitiescryptocurrency has been designed to be accepted by all the merchants directlyonly after that happens exchanges have a right to come to the scene
18737,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,dead man walking  hes fucked and do id that midget snaggldtooth girlfriend
18738,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,crypto was already killing the environment and now its killing the economy
18739,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he was the front man to this democrat run money laundering operation  if you had money on the exchange you were just caught in the crosshairs you will never find out what really went down because the democrat party has their dirty hands all over this

18765,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,imagine doing fractional reserve banking without an authority to stop bank runs the whole reason frb works is because there is typically a government with guns telling you you cant withdraw
18766,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,haha man last week was so damn crazy
18767,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,do kwon will come back stronger than ever to fuck shit up worse than sbf

18769,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sbf has a back door which will soon be unlocked by many eager soap dropping prisoners
18770,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,wtf is sbf doing
18771,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,what are the odds of a disgruntled investor finding sbf and putting him away in cold storage i lost only a few solana and ftt that i couldnt be bothered to withdraw but i can only imagine the hatred that people feel who lost significant sums he cannot run forever and someone must be looking to track him down
18772,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sorry guys i know lots of you lost money but i just cant understand the stupidity at throwing money at these obvious ponzi schemes what is crypto for if not opt in censorship resistant self custody not your keys nor your coins get your coins off exchanges ring any bells
18773,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,he elaborated further

18785,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,wow well the writing is on the wall and the color is predetermined this whole mess and the timing of it is precise to the t this is the checkmate so many wondered how can the sec protect investors effectively they will implement law requiring investments into cryptocurrency only be allowed for accredited investors so bull run bear market who cares really only accredited investors look up the requirements to become an accredited investor and you will see how they have killed the retail investor
18786,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,sounds like you three dudes are getting cryptod right now  someone creeped into your head and is now making you doubt the very thing that got you here dont let them in  i bet by april youll have wished you bought at

18789,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57, i know it seems bad right now but i actually see this as being bullish long term we need better from these corporations that hold our money we need change and this is a great start
18790,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,this do question me now are  yo’s capable of running a multibillion dollar platform
18791,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,if ftx is hackeddont you think that his twitter is hacked too
18792,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,imo all of this is just a long overdue wake up callif you got into crypto with  interest in a decentralized permissionless trustless parallel financial system you deserve this
18793,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,💎 🙌 forever right

18797,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i thought his account was also hacked
18798,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i thought a lack of regulation was heralded as a good thing in the crypto markets
18799,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,anything else thing it was just a scheduled tweet he never got around to deleting or finishing
18800,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,rip

18806,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i still can’t believe this is our reality lol
18807,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,i disagree sure ftx is another incident that adds to the pile but imo it’s not necessarily the single event that suddenly increases the worries of legislators about security and protecting consumers those worries are way older than 
18808,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,ripppp
18809,yuorb4,2022-11-14 04:25:57,so bad on those involved

19190,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,this isnt actually all that odd it takes a lot of work to get a banking license and you need your shit organized properly buying a small bank is often a back door to getting a license which would be a natural part of a business plan for something like ftx
19191,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,they didnt lose all that money in bad bets or high leverage they stole it they embezzled it
19192,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,this is a much better source interestingly involves jean chalopin the chairman of deltec bank in the bahamas and his son janvier chalopin jean chalopin was producer of kids cartoons including inspector gadget before becoming a banker deltec is tether’s bank once again alameda  tether  sbf  bahamas
19193,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,i’m getting so sick of seeing this ugly mf’ers face and his girlfriend…don’t get me started on his girlfriend

19195,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,“it’s totally normal i swear”
19196,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,nothing sus about that it is normal for a  billion dollar scam outfit to own a stake in a tiny bank youve never heard of with only three employees

19268,z3isqs,2022-11-24 12:33:27,if someone still believes that bumbling moron was the head of a sophisticated money laundering scheme time to wake the fuck up the whole operation smells like letter agency soup spiced up with people from upper echelons of politics

19662,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,top post on rcryptocurrency is telling people to phone their bank and ask for a refund under consumer regulations iconic
19663,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,you must not know my bank  i can’t even get them to answer the phone
19664,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,unfortunately this is false this rule only applies to fund transfer errors definition of error    types of transfers or inquiries covered  the term “error” means i an unauthorized electronic fund transfer ii an incorrect electronic fund transfer to or from the consumers account iii the omission of an electronic fund transfer from a periodic statement iv a computational or bookkeeping error made by the financial institution relating to an electronic fund transfer v the consumers receipt of an incorrect amount of money from an electronic terminal vi an electronic fund transfer not identified in accordance with §  or §  or vii the consumers request for documentation required by §  or §  or for additional information or clarification concerning an electronic fund transfer including a request the consumer makes to determine whether an error exists under paragraphs  through vi of this sectionnotice of error from consumer    timing contents  a financial institution shall comply with the requirements of this section with respect to any oral or written notice of error from the consumer that i is received by the institution no later than  days after the institution sends the periodic statement or provides the passbook documentation required by §  on which the alleged error is first reflected
19665,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,the bank will file your request of course they can’t deny your request…  they can require a police report an investigation mediation settlement arbitration and all the other terms of your account that you agreed to when opening the account and every time they mailed you all the new updated terms of your account that you agreed to by continuing to bank with them  good luck
19666,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,i don’t believe this is how reg e works you have to be tricked into sending the money if you meant to send the money to the recipient the reversal right does not exist people meant to send the money what they bought was just stupid bank is probably not responsible
19667,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,first people complain and point fingers when banks block transfers to crypto exchanges how dare they tell me what to do with my money when it all blows up people then ask the banks to reimburse their funds  after all the banks took the risk of allowing the transferyou cant make this stuff up
19668,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,man regulations suck amrite guys 🥴
19669,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,as others have said dont do this best case scenario your bank reverses your reversal and charges you a fee for filing a fraudulent ach reversal worst case you get sued by silvergate or ftx lawyers decide to press criminal charges against you for wire fraudvoyager customers who did an ach reversal have been sent emails from lawyers threatening lawsuits and potential criminal charges
19670,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,i dont think this works if the person actually authorized the transfer this refund only applies to unauthorized electronic fund transfers  aka someone other than you so for those whose funds were somehow hacked from their account then yes i think you have a chance for refund but for most who lost the funds due to inability to remove funds from exchange and personally authorized the preceding deposit into said exchange  outta luck at least thats my interpretation when i read the full text
19671,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,boy oh boy those regulations sure do come in handy don’t they
19672,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,lol all those financial regulations seem pretty nice now dont they
19673,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,and you people wonder why banks take issue with crypto transactions
19674,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,hate to say that this is just not how it works people have made shitty investments with shitty companies and shitty people since that dude in mesopotamia complained about his bronze purity or some shityou sent the money to ftx that’s not your bank’s fault  they know that don’t waste your own time please
19675,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,looooooooooooool banks to save the day oh boy the irony
19676,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,and people wonder why banks have call waits for  minutes its stupid people like op trying to chance their luck and get a refund then arguing for the next  minutes like the person on the other end has any idea what you are talking about which is not a lot
19677,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,if this works i expect a lot of banks to start refusing deposits to crypto exchanges very soon certainly have had a similar experience when i bought airline tickets and the airline went bankrupt and cancelled all flights bank was obligated to refund the money and did so that was in the uk
19678,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,the hilarity of watching crypto bros try to run back to banks and chargeback using consumer protections is not lost on us
19679,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,ftx was based in bermuda well awsy from any us regulations

19690,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,posting here for more visibility read this article this will give you an overview on how reg e is applied vs how nacha rules for ach reversals can occuryour bank may be able to reverse an ach transaction based on nacha operating rules financial institutions have an agreement with the clearing house or federal reserve ach operator to transmit entries on the ach network on behalf of the originator there are specific rules that address how ach return codes are applied and processed and it is my understanding this is an automated process and a general agreement and understanding with other members on the ach network that allows for reversals and returns to process within  days of the transaction occurringin theory your bank could process an ach return by selecting the  reason code and the funds would be automatically reversed nacha has updated their guidance and it appears it repurposed its  code for “errors” vs  for unauthorized transfers i am not sure if this will work most bankers and customer representatives are not verse in nacha guidelines but it is worth a shot to use similar jargon as defined by nacha when submitting a request for an ach reversal this only applies to ach transactions you are sol on remittance transfers wires and debitcredit transactions i hope this helps but regulation e doesn’t guarantee a refund
19691,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,sam bankman fried hates this one simple trick

19698,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,i think this would work if you used a credit card to fund right crypto is an asset and you can argue it was not delieverex
19699,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,if banks go through with this i can see it being in the news next week something about how banks will bail you out but crypto wont

19716,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,i wired  to ftx  days before they went bankrupt and got my money back by doing a wire recall with my bank
19717,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,i called my bank and they said that they aren’t able to dispute the transfer since it was authorized they didn’t know about section e of the cfpb or care

19733,yyyp4o,2022-11-19 00:11:04,what’s interesting is we see all these posts about the ftx collapse and all the bullshit shenanigans behind the scenes but i haven’t seen one post about anyone getting burned by this or even someone being able to withdraw on time don’t forget when all this was unfolding and cz bought a days worth of bank run people were still able to withdraw i think more money was able to be taken out than left in i’d love to know how many proactive people were spared somebody said tom brady and the wife lost  is that even possible
